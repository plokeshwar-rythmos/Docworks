# GPU Profiler

![GPU Usage Profiler](../uploads/Main/GPUProfiler.png)

The GPU Usage Profiler displays where GPU time is spent in your game. When you select this Profiler, the lower pane displays hierarchical time data for the selected frame. Select an item from the Hierarchy to see a breakdown of contributions in the right-hand panel. See documentation on the [Profiler window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProfilerWindow.html) to learn more about the information in the Profiler.

Note that GPU profiling is disabled when __Graphics Jobs (Experimental)__ is enabled in the __Player Settings__. See documentation on [Standalone Player Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/550/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsStandalone.html) for more information. On macOS, GPU profiling is only available under OSX 10.9 Mavericks and later versions.

## Profiling within the Unity Editor

The Editor supports profiling on Windows with Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 11 APIs only. This has both advantages and disadvantages: it is convenient for quick profiling, because it means you donâ€™t need to build the Player; however, the Profiler is affected by the overhead of running the Unity Editor, which can make the profiling results less accurate.
