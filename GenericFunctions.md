Generic Functions
=================


Some functions in the script reference (for example, the various GetComponent functions) are listed with 
a variant that has a letter T or a type name in angle brackets after the function name:


````
//C#
void FuncName<T>();
//JS
function FuncName.<T>(): T;
````
These are known as generic functions. The significance they have for scripting is that you get
to specify the types of parameters and/or the return type when you call the function. In JavaScript, this can
be used to get around the limitations of dynamic typing:-


````
// The type is correctly inferred since it is defined in the function call.
//In C#
var obj = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
//In JS
var obj = GetComponent.<Rigidbody>();
````
In C#, it can save a lot of keystrokes and casts:

````
Rigidbody rb = go.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();

// ...as compared with:

Rigidbody rb = (Rigidbody) go.GetComponent(typeof(Rigidbody));
````
Any function that has a generic variant listed on its script reference page will allow this
special calling syntax.
