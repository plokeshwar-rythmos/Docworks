Viewing the status of your Asset Store submissions
===============

You can view the publishing status of your asset via the __Pending__ tab in your [Publisher Administration Page](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/)

Submission status
------

|||
|:---|:---|
| **Pending:** | This shows all assets that have been received and are in the submission queue awaiting review from the vetting team. You should only contact [assetstore@unity3d.com](mailto:assetstore@unity3d.com) if the asset has not been reviewed within 10 working days of submission. |
| **Published:** | This will show all assets that are currently published on the Asset Store. |
| **Declined:** | This shows all assets that were submitted and declined by the Asset Store vetting team. |
| **Disabled:** | This will show all assets that have been disabled from the Asset Store. |

If the asset does not appear in the pending queue, then it has either been been accepted to the store, or it has not been created as a package.

If your asset is removed from the store for any reason, a notification email is sent to the main email address attached to your publisher account.
