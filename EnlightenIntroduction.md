# Introduction to Enlighten

Unity uses a third-party lighting system called **Enlighten** for indirect lighting. Enlighten performs Global Illumination calculations in real time across multiple platforms. Visit the [Enlighten homepage](http://www.geomerics.com/enlighten) for more information about the technology. 

Take a look at some of the guides Unity provides about using Enlighten with Unity below: 

* Unity Expert Guide: [Using Enlighten in Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/uploads/ExpertGuides/Using%20Enlighten%20with%20Unity.pdf). This document outlines the benefits of Enlighten, as well as the algorithms involved.

* Unity tutorial: [Global Illumination](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/introduction-precomputed-realtime-gi?playlist=17102). Learn how to optimize a Scene for Enlighten, and find more information on the lighting system.
