# Funnel Analyzer tab 

Funnels track player progress through linear sequences of events, tasks, or actions in your game. You can use funnels to better understand how players move through important sequences and to detect possible bottlenecks where players run into problems. Create funnel reports on the Funnel Analyzer page of your Analytics Dashboard.

Before creating a funnel report, you must implement the necessary Standard and Custom Events in your project. See [Funnels](UnityAnalyticsFunnels) for more information on designing, implementing, and analyzing funnels.
