Exporting Packages
=======================================


As you build your game, Unity stores a lot of metadata about your assets, such as import settings and links to other assets, among other information. If you want to transfer your assets into a different project and preserve all this information, you can export your assets as a __Custom Package__.

See [Asset Packages](AssetPackages) for detailed information on using __packages__, including importing and exporting.

###Exporting New Packages
Use __Export Package__ to create your own __Custom Package__.

1. Open the project you want to export assets from.
2. Choose __Assets > Export Packageâ€¦__ from the menu to bring up the __Exporting Package__ dialog box.
(See *Fig 1: Exporting Package dialog box*.)
3. In the dialog box, select the assets you want to include in the package by clicking on the boxes so they are checked.
4. Leave the __include dependencies__ box checked to auto-select any assets used by the ones you have selected. 
5. Click on __Export__ to bring up File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) and choose where you want to store your package file. 
Name and save the package anywhere you like.

**HINT:** When exporting a package Unity can export all dependencies as well. 
So, for example, if you select a Scene and export a package with all dependencies, then all models, 
textures and other assets that appear in the scene will be exported as well. 
This can be a quick way of exporting a bunch of assets without manually locating them all.

###Exporting Updated Packages
Sometimes you may want to change the contents of a package and create a newer, updated version of your asset package. 
To do this:

* Select the asset files you want in your package (select both the unchanged ones and the new ones).

* Export the files as described above in ***Export Package***, above. 

**NOTE:** You can re-name an updated package and Unity will recognise it as an update, so you can use incremental naming, for example: MyAssetPackageVer1, MyAssetPackageVer2.

**HINT:** It is not good practise to remove files from packages and then replace them with the same name:
Unity will recognise them as different and possibly conflicting files and so display a warning symbol when they are imported.
If you have removed a file and then decide to replace it, it is better to give it a different, but related name to the original.
