#The Learn tab

The __Learn__ tab in the Home window gives you access to a variety of tutorials and learning resources (including example Projects that you can import directly into Unity) to help you get started with Unity. 

The Learn tab is visible in the Home window after Unity is opened. The Home window can also be accessed from within the Editor by navigating to __File__ > __New__ __Project__.

The Learn tab is split into four sections: 

* __Basic Tutorials__
* __Tutorial Projects__
* __Resources__
* __Links__

##Basic Tutorials

The __Basic Tutorials__ section contains interactive in-Editor tutorials. These tutorials take you through the very basics of interacting with Unityâ€™s interface and main development tools. To download each tutorial, click __Download__, then when the download is complete, click __Launch__. 

## Tutorial Projects

The __Tutorial Projects__ section contains a list of tutorial Projects that you can import into Unity. 

Each tutorial includes a full example Project, along with written and video guides, and all the resources you need to complete the Project yourself. 

To download and import a tutorial Project into Unity, click the __Download__ button to the right of the relevant Project. Unity then downloads all of the required Assets for the tutorial Project you have selected. When the download has finished, click the __Start__ button to automatically create and open a new Project that contains all of the resources you need to follow the tutorial.

To access the video guides and full tutorials, click the __Read More__ button to the right of the Project you want to know more about.

You can also follow a video tutorial for your chosen Project on the [Unity Learn](https://unity3d.com/learn) website. 

## Resources

The __Resources __section contains links to [Asset Packages](AssetPackages) that can be imported into your Project. Asset Packages contain resources such as 3D models, Particle effects, and pre-made scripts that you can use to quickly build Projects. 

To download an Asset Package from the Learn tab, click the __Download__ button to the right of the Asset Package you want to download. Unity then automatically downloads all of the Assets included in your chosen Asset Package.

To use these Assets in a Project, click the __Launch__ button. Unity then automatically creates and opens a Project containing the downloaded Assets. 

When downloading tutorials or resources, you can click the __X__ button to the right of the progress bar to cancel the download. 

## Links

The __Links__ section contains links to Unity Learn guides and tutorials, along with a link to the Unity Community homepage. 

Click the __Read More __button to the right of the link description to open it in a new internet browser window.
