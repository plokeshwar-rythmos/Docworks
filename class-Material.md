#Material

Materials are used in conjunction with [Mesh Renderers](class-MeshRenderer), [Particle Systems](class-ParticleSystem) and other rendering components used in Unity. They play an essential part in defining how your object is displayed.

##Properties

The properties that a Material's inspector displays are determined by the __Shader__ that the Material uses. A shader is a specialised kind of graphical program that determines how texture and lighting information are combined to generate the pixels of the rendered object onscreen. See the manual section about [Shaders](Shaders) for in-depth information about how they are used in a Unity project.
