Step 6: Wait for feedback
============

You now need to wait for feedback from the Unity developers, who are monitoring the repository you are contributing changes to and will have been notified automatically of your pull request. They may have questions, concerns or other feedback, and will communicate these through your pull request, so make sure you're set up to receive notifications from Bitbucket. When the change is accepted, the Unity developer will take care of merging your changes into the official repository maintained by Unity.
