# Shading Language used in Unity

In Unity, [shader programs](SL-ShaderPrograms) are written in a variant of [HLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Shading_Language) language (also called [Cg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cg_%28programming_language%29) but for most practical uses the two are the same).

Currently, for maximum portability between different platforms, writing in DX9-style HLSL (e.g. use DX9 style `sampler2D` and `tex2D` for texture sampling instead of DX10 style `Texture2D`, `SamplerState` and `tex.Sample`).

## Shader Compilers

Internally, different shader compilers are used for [shader program](SL-ShaderPrograms) compilation:

* Windows & Microsoft platforms (DX11, DX12 and Xbox One) all use Microsoft's
  HLSL compiler (currently d3dcompiler_47).
* OpenGL Core, OpenGL ES 3 and Metal use Microsoft's HLSL followed by bytecode translation into GLSL or Metal,
  using [HLSLcc](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/HLSLcc).
* OpenGL ES 2.0 uses source level translation via
  [hlsl2glslfork](https://github.com/aras-p/hlsl2glslfork) and [glsl optimizer](https://github.com/aras-p/glsl-optimizer).
* Other console platforms use their respective compilers (e.g. PSSL on PS4).
* [Surface Shaders](SL-SurfaceShaders) use Cg 2.2 and [MojoShader](https://icculus.org/mojoshader/) for code generation analysis step.


In case you really need to identify which compiler is being used (to use HLSL syntax only supported by one compiler, or to work around a compiler bug), [predefined shader macros](SL-BuiltinMacros) can be used. For example, `UNITY_COMPILER_HLSL` is set when compiling with HLSL compiler (for D3D or GLCore/GLES3 platforms); and `UNITY_COMPILER_HLSL2GLSL` when compiling via hlsl2glsl.
