#Player Settings

The __Player Settings__ (menu: __Edit > Project Settings > Player__) let you set various options for the final game built by Unity. There are a few settings that are the same regardless of the build target but most are platform-specific and divided into the following sections:

* **Resolution and Presentation**: settings for screen resolution and other presentation details such as whether the game should default to fullscreen mode.
* **Icon**: the game icon(s) as shown on the desktop.
* **Splash Image**: the image shown while the game is launching.
* **Other Settings**: any remaining settings specific to the platform.
* **Publishing Settings**: details of how the built application is prepared for delivery from the app store or host webpage.

The general settings are covered below. Settings specific to a platform can be found separately in the [platform's own manual section](PlatformSpecific).
