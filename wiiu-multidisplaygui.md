Multi Display GUI (Wii U)
====

In Unity 5.3 and onward on the Wii U, user interface elements generated by the Immediate Mode GUI system (using OnGUI) can be displayed and interacted with on each display separately.

To use this feature, use the __displayIndex__ property has been added to UnityEngine.Event class. This property indicates which display the current OnGUI event relates to.

If you do not want to use OnGUI UI elements on some displays, you can avoid the performance overhead of having the OnGUI function called when it would simply be ignored for those displays. To do this, you must use the attribute __[GUITarget(a, b, ...)]__, where the passed values specify the index number of each display that you want to use. Other displays that are not listed in the attribute will be ignored for the purposes of calling the OnGUI function.
