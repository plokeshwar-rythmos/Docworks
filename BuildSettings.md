# Build Settings

The Build Settings window allows you to choose your target platform, adjust settings for your build, and start the build process. To access the Build Settings window, select __File__ > __Build Settings...__ . Once you have specified your build settings, you can click __Build__ to create your build, or click the __Build And Run__ to create and run your build on the platform you have specified.

## Scenes in Build

This part of the window shows you the scenes from your project that will be included in your build.  If no scenes are shown then you can use the *Add Current* button to add the current scene to the build, or you can drag scene assets into this window from your project window. You can also untick scenes in this list to exclude them from the build without removing it from the list.  If a scene is never needed in the build you can remove it from the list of scenes by pressing the delete key.

Scenes that are ticked and added to the Scenes in Build list will be included in the build. The list of scenes will be used to control the order the scenes are loaded. You can adjust the order of the scenes by dragging them up or down.

## Platform List

The Platform area beneath the Scenes in Build area list all the platforms which are available to your Unity version.  Some platforms may be greyed out to indicate they are not part of your version or invite you to download the platform specific build options.  Selecting one of the platforms will control which platform will be built. If you change the target platform, you need to press the "Switch Platform" button to apply your change.  This may take some time making the switch, because your assets may need to be re-imported in formats that match your target platform.  The currently selected platform is indicated with a Unity icon to the right of the platform name.

The selected platform will show a list of options that can be adjusted for the build.  Each platform may have different options.  These options are listed below.  Options that are common across many platforms are listed at the very bottom of this section under the "Generic items across builds" details.
