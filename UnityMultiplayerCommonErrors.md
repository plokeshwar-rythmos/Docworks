#Common Errors

Two common errors you might encounter are:

`Create match failed: Failed to access NetworkDB appId=0`

This occurs if you have not linked the project with Unity Services. To link your project with Unity Services, see [Setting up your project for Unity Services](SettingUpProjectServices).

`Create match failed: Failed because of invalid projectid setup. Please verify project setup at https://multiplayer.unity3d.com`

This occurs if you have not enabled the Multiplayer Service. To fix this, [make sure you have set up your project for Multiplayer Services correctly](UnityMultiplayerSettingUp).
