Particle Systems (Legacy, prior to release 3.5)
===============================================


__Particles__ are essentially 2D images rendered in 3D space. They are primarily used for effects such as smoke, fire, water droplets, or leaves. A __Particle System__ is made up of three separate Components: __Particle Emitter__, __Particle Animator__, and a __Particle Renderer__. You can use a Particle Emitter and Renderer together if you want static particles. The Particle Animator will move particles in different directions and change colors. You also have access to each individual particle in a particle system via scripting, so you can create your own unique behaviors that way if you choose.

This section describes the various components available in the legacy particle system.
