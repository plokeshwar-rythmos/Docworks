Reverting files
===============

Some changes made to a working copy of a file might not be suitable for publishing to the project.

If you have local changes you do not want to publish, click the **Revert asset** button next to the changed file. This removes any local changes you have made to that file.

To confirm the removal of the local files, click **Yes** in the file revert dialog box.
