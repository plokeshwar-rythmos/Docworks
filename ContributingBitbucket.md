Step 1: Get a Bitbucket account
============

Our open-source components are hosted on [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/) under the [Unity-Technologies team](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies).  You don't need to be logged in to access the repositories and clone the source code, but you will need an account in order to be able to contribute your changes.

To get started, visit [Bitbucket's account sign-up page](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/).

If you don't want to make a new account, Bitbucket supports [OpenID](http://openid.net/get-an-openid/what-is-openid/), which will let you log in with your Google, Facebook, Twitter, or GitHub account.
