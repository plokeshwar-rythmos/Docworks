# Post-processing overview

__Post-processing__ is the process of applying full-screen filters and effects to a cameraâ€™s image buffer before it is displayed to screen. It can drastically improve the visuals of your product with little setup time.

You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties; for example; __Bloom__, __Depth of Field__, __Chromatic Aberration__ or __Color Grading__.

### Using post-processing

To use post-processing in your project you can import Unity's [post-processing stack](PostProcessing-Stack). You can also write your own post-processing effects. See [Writing post-processing effects](PostProcessingWritingEffects) for details.

The images below demonstrate a Scene with and without post-processing.
