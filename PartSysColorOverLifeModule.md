#Color Over Lifetime module

This module specifies how a particle's color and transparency changes over its lifetime.

##Properties

|**_Property:_** |**_Function:_** |
|:---|:---|
|__Color__ |The color gradient of a particle over its lifetime. The very left-hand point of the gradient bar indicates the beginning of the particle's life, and the very right-hand side of the gradient bar indicates the end of the particle's life. <br/><br/>In the image above, the particle starts off orange, fades in opacity over time, and is invisible by the time its life ends.|

##Details

Many types of natural and fantastical particles vary in color over time, and so this property has many uses. For example, white hot sparks will cool as they pass through the air and a magic spell might burst into a rainbow of colors. Equally important, though, is the variation of alpha (transparency). It is very common for particles to burn out, fade or dissipate as they reach the end of their lifetime (for example, hot sparks, fireworks and smoke particles) and a simple diminishing gradient produces this effect.
