Reflective Normal mapped Vertex-lit
===================================

**Note.** Unity 5 introduced the [Standard Shader](shader-StandardShader) which replaces this shader.

Special Properties
------------------


This shader is a good alternative to Reflective Normal mapped. If you do not need the object itself to be affected by pixel lights, but do want the reflection to be affected by a normal map, this shader is for you. This shader is vertex-lit, so it is rendered more quickly than its Reflective Normal mapped counterpart.

Performance
-----------


Generally, this shader is not expensive to render. For more details, please view the [Shader Peformance page](shader-Performance).
