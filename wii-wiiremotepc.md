###What will you need ?

* bluetooth adapter (if your PC doesn't have one)
* software for connecting bluetooth to PC:
    * Bluesoleil (http://www.bluesoleil.com/), the latest version costs money, but I think earlier versions are still free if you can find them on the internet
* plugin source (you can find the download link at the bottom of this page)
* WiiRemote
* Unity2011-03-14 build or later.


###Supported controllers:

* WiiRemote
    * Buttons
    * IR
    * Acceleration

    * Buttons
    * Stick
* ClassicController
    * Buttons
    * Sticks

    * A joystick shaped icon should appear named 'Nintendo RVL-CNT-01'
    * Right-click on it and select 'Search Services' (if the leds on the WiiRemote stopped flashing, press Sync button again)
    * After few seconds right-click on the icon again, a new menu item should appear - 'Connect Bluetooth Human Interface Device), click on it
    * WiiRemote is now connected to PC and we can start using it


* Compiling the plugin


    * Before you can use the plugin in Unity, you must compile it, go to WiiPadEmu-&gt;PluginSource-&gt;WiiPadEmu, open Win32WPad.sln
    * There are four configurations:
        * DebugWinForms, ReleaseWinforms - can be used for plugin testing without launching the Unity.
        * DebugUnity, ReleaseUnity - compiles the plugin and copies necessary files to WiiPadEmu\Assets\Plugins directory.
    * Just the suitable one and compile it


* Testing the plugin without Unity


    * If you've chosen DebugWinForms or ReleaseWinForms and were succesful in compiling the project, you should be able to launch application Win32WPadTest
