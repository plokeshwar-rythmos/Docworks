# GameObjects

The __GameObject__ is the most important concept in the Unity Editor.

Every object in your game is a __GameObject__, from characters and collectible items to lights, cameras and special effects. However, a GameObject can't do anything on its own; you need to give it properties before it can become a character, an environment, or a special effect. 


![Four different types of GameObject: an animated character, a light, a tree, and an audio source](../uploads/Main/GameObjectsExamples.png)

To give a GameObject the properties it needs to become a light, or a tree, or a camera, you need to add [components](Components) to it. Depending on what kind of object you want to create, you add different combinations of components to a GameObject. 

You can think of a GameObject as an empty cooking pot, and components as different ingredients that make up the recipe of your game. Unity has lots of different built-in component types, and you can also make your own components using the [Unity Scripting API](CreatingComponents).

This section explains how GameObjects, components and the Scripting API fit together, and how to create and use them.
