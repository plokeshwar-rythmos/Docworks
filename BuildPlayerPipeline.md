#Build Player Pipeline


When building a player, you sometimes want to modify the built player in some way. For example you might want to add a custom icon, copy some documentation next to the player or build an Installer. You can do this via editor scripting using [BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer](ScriptRef:BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer.html) to run the build and then follow it with whatever postprocessing code you need:-


````
// JS example.

import System.Diagnostics;

class ScriptBatch {
    @MenuItem("MyTools/Windows Build With Postprocess")
    static function BuildGame() {
        // Get filename.
        var path = EditorUtility.SaveFolderPanel("Choose Location of Built Game", "", "");
        var levels : String[] = ["Assets/Scene1.unity", "Assets/Scene2.unity"];
        
        // Build player.
        BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer(levels, path + "/BuiltGame.exe", BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows, BuildOptions.None);

        // Copy a file from the project folder to the build folder, alongside the built game.
        FileUtil.CopyFileOrDirectory("Assets/Templates/Readme.txt", path + "Readme.txt");

        // Run the game (Process class from System.Diagnostics).
        var proc = new Process();
        proc.StartInfo.FileName = path + "/BuiltGame.exe";
        proc.Start();
    }
}
````

````
// C# example.
using UnityEditor;
using System.Diagnostics;

public class ScriptBatch 
{
    [MenuItem("MyTools/Windows Build With Postprocess")]
    public static void BuildGame ()
    {
        // Get filename.
        string path = EditorUtility.SaveFolderPanel("Choose Location of Built Game", "", "");
        string[] levels = new string[] {"Assets/Scene1.unity", "Assets/Scene2.unity"};

        // Build player.
        BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer(levels, path + "/BuiltGame.exe", BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows, BuildOptions.None);

        // Copy a file from the project folder to the build folder, alongside the built game.
        FileUtil.CopyFileOrDirectory("Assets/Templates/Readme.txt", path + "Readme.txt");

        // Run the game (Process class from System.Diagnostics).
        Process proc = new Process();
        proc.StartInfo.FileName = path + "/BuiltGame.exe";
        proc.Start();
    }
}

##PostProcessBuild Attribute


You can also use the postprocessOrder parameter of the [PostProcessBuildAttribute](ScriptRef:Callbacks.PostProcessBuildAttribute.html) to define the execution order for your build methods, and call your external scripts with the Process class from these methods as shown in the last section. This parameter is used to sort the build methods from lower to higher, and you can assign any negative or positive value to it.
