Importing Objects From Modo
===========================


Unity natively imports modo files. This works under the hood by using the modo COLLADA exporter. Modo version 501 and later use this approach. To get started, save your .lxo file in the project's Assets folder. When you switch back into Unity, the file is imported automatically and will show up in the Project View.

For older modo versions prior to 501, simply save your Modo scene as an FBX or COLLADA file into the Unity project folder. When you switch back into Unity, the scene is imported automatically and will show up in the __Project View__.

To see your model in Unity, drag it from the Project View into the __Scene View__.

If you modify the lxo file, Unity will automatically update whenever you save.
