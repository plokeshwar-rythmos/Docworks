Colors and Gradients in the Particle System (Shuriken)
======================================================



![](../uploads/Main/ShurikenColorProperty.png) 
For properties that deal with color, the __Particle System__ makes use of the __Color and Gradient Editor__. 
It works in a similar way to the [Curve Editor](ParticleSystemCurveEditor).

The color-based properties will have a pull down menu on the right hand side, where you can choose between: 

__Gradient__: The gradient (RGBA) will vary throughout time, edited in the [Gradient Editor](GradientEditor)

__Random Between Two Gradients__: The gradient (RGBA) varies with time and is chosen at random between two values specified [Gradient Editor](GradientEditor)
