# How IL2CPP works

Upon starting a build using [IL2CPP](IL2CPP), Unity automatically performs the following steps: 

1. Unity Scripting API code is compiled to regular .NET DLLs (managed assemblies).

2. All managed assemblies that arenâ€™t part of scripts (such as plugins and base class libraries) are processed by a Unity tool called Unused Bytecode Stripper, which finds all unused classes and methods and removes them from these DLLs (Dynamic Link Library). This step significantly reduces the size of a built game.

3. All managed assemblies are then converted to standard C++ code.

4. The generated C++ code and the runtime part of IL2CPP is compiled using a native platform compiler.

5. Finally, the code is linked into either an executable file or a DLL, depending on the platform you are targeting.

IL2CPP provides a few useful options which you can control by attributes in your scripts. See documentation on [Platform-dependent compilation](PlatformDependentCompilation) for further information.
