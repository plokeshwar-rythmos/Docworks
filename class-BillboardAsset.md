#Billboard Asset


A Billboard Asset is a collection of pre-rendered images of a more complicated Mesh intended for use with the [Billboard Renderer](class-BillboardRenderer), in order to render an object at some distance from a Camera at a lower level of detail (LOD) to save on rendering time.

The most common way to generate a Billboard Asset is to create files in [SpeedTree Modeler](http://www.speedtree.com/tree-modeler.php), and then import them into Unity. It is also possible to create your own Billboard Assets from script. See the API reference for [BillboardAsset](ScriptRef:BillboardAsset) for further details.
