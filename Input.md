#Input

Unity supports the most conventional types of input device used with games (such as controllers, joypads, keyboard and mouse) but also the touchscreens and movement-sensing capabilities of mobile devices. It also supports input from VR and AR systems.

Additionally, Unity can make use of a computer's microphone and webcam to input audio and video data. See the [Audio](Audio) and [Graphics](Graphics) sections of the manual for further information.
