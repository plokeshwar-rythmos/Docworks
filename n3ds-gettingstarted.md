##Developing for Nintendo 3DS
To develop for the Nintendo 3DS you must be a Nintendo registered developer and own the appropriate hardware.

##Build Information
The required SDK version is specified in the release notes of each respective Nintendo 3DS Add-on/Unity build.

##Access Nintendo 3DS Unique Functionality
Unity for Nintendo 3DS provides a number of new scripting APIs to access device-specific hardware, services, and much more. See the UnityEngine.N3DS namespace in the scripting API.

##How Unity for Nintendo 3DS differs from Desktop Unity

* Limited shader support.
	* Unity for Nintendo 3DS only supports Mobile/Legacy shaders.
	* It does not allow user-specified shaders. 
* Limited memory
	* The console has a total of 124MiB of System (Main) Memory and 6MiB of Video Memory. The Unity Player and compiled scripts will use some of this.
