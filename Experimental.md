# Experimental

Unity features which are in development. 

Unity Technologies supplies some experimental features with the standard Unity Editor installer, which you download from the [Unity store](https://store.unity.com/). Other experimental features you need to download from the [Unity Technologies GitHub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies) and install separately, once you have installed the Unity Editor.



**In-Editor experimental features**

To access experimental features in Unity, go to __Window__ > __Experimental__ > [name of feature]

Experimental features:

* [Look Dev](LookDev): An image-based lighting tool that allows you to check and compare different Assets through a viewer to ensure they are correctly authored for various lighting conditions.


**Plugin experimental features**

To access Unity experimental feature plugins, download them from the  [Unity Technologies GitHub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies) and install them separately to the Unity Editor.
