### Splitting clips

You can split a clip into two identical clips with different starts, ends, and durations. Splitting clips is non-destructive. The start or end of the clip can be extended to include the split animation or audio. You can also [reset a clip](TimelineResettingClips) to undo a split or other edits.

To split a clip, position the playhead within the clip to be split and either Right-click the clip and select __Editing__ > __Split__, or press S. The clip is split into two separate clips that can be positioned, trimmed, and edited independently.
