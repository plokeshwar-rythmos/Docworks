#Sprite Creator

With this tool you can create temporary placeholder __sprite__ (2D) graphics. You can use these in your project during development and then replace them with the graphics you want to use.


##Accessing the Sprite Creator

Select __Assets>Create>Sprites__ and then select the placeholder sprite you want to make (square, triangle, diamond, hexagon, or polygon).

##Using the Sprite

Your new placeholder sprite appears as a white shape in the asset folder you currently have open. The new sprite's name defaults to its shape name but you have the option to rename your sprite when it is first created. If you are not sure what you want to call it, leave it as the default; you can change it later by clicking on it.

You can drag and drop your placeholder sprite into the __Scene View__ or  __Hierarchy__ to start using it in your project.

##Replacing your Placeholder Sprite

To change your placeholder sprite, click on it in the __Scene View__ and then edit via the __Sprite Renderer Component__ in the __Inspector__.

Edit the __Sprite__ field: You can click on the small circle to the right of the input field to bring up the __Sprite Selector__ where you can browse and select from a menu of available 2D graphic assets.

##Details

* The Sprite Creator makes 4x4 white PNG outline textures.
* The placeholder sprites are perfect primitive polygons (e.g. triangle, hexagon, n-sided polygon), generated by algorithm.
* **NOTE:** Placeholder sprites are not like 3D primitives: A sprite is an asset, and as a many-sided polygon, may represent many different shapes, so placeholder sprites are not built like 3D primitives.
