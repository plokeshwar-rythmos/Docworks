The __Tags and Layers Manager__ allows you to set up __Tags__, __Sorting Layers__ and __Layers__. To view the Tags and Layers Manager, go to __Edit__ > __Project Settings__ > __Tags and Layers__.

##Details

__Tags__: These are marker values that that you can use to identify objects in your project (see documentation on [Tags](Tags) for further details). To add a new Tag, click the plus button (+) at the bottom-right of the list, and name your new Tag.

Note that once you have named a Tag, you cannot rename it. To remove a Tag, click on it and then click the minus (-) button at the bottom-right of the list.

__Sorting Layers__: Used in conjunction with [Sprite](Sprites) graphics in the 2D system, "sorting" refers to the overlay order of different Sprites.

To add and remove Sorting Layers, use the plus and minus (+/-) buttons at the bottom-right of the list. To change their order, drag the handle at the left-hand side of each Layer item.

__Layers__: Use these throughout the Unity Editor as a way to create groups of objects that share particular characteristics (see documentation on [Layers](Layers) for further details). User Layers  primarily to restrict operations such as raycasting or rendering, so that they are only applied to the relevant groups of objects. In the Tags and Layers Manager, the first eight __Builtin Layers__ are defaults used by Unity, so you cannot edit them. However, you can customise __User Layers__ from 8 to 31.

To customise __User Layers__ from 8 to 31; type a custom name into the text field for each one you wish to use. Note that you can't add to the number of Layers but, unlike Tags, you can rename Layers.
