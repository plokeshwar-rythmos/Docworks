# In-Progress edit notifications

Unity Collaborate constantly monitors the changes team members make to your Project. When a team member saves changes to a Scene or Prefab on their local machine, Collaborate notifies you that the Asset has been changed by displaying an In-Progress badge on the Asset. 

To view who is working on the Scene or Prefab, hover over the badge.

When a team member publishes their changes, Unity removes the icon and counter.
