|**_Property:_** |**_Function:_** |
|:---|:---|
|__Center freq__ |The frequency in Hertz where the gain is applied (range 20.0 to 22000.0, default = 8000.0 Hz).|
|__Octave Range__ |The number of Octaves over which the gain is applied (Centered on the Center Frequency) (range 0.20 to 5.00, default = 1.0 octave).|
|__Frequency Gain__ |The gain applied (range 0.05 to 3.00, default = 1.00 - no gain applied).|


##Details

The graph shows the effect of the gain to be applied over the frequency range of the audio output.
