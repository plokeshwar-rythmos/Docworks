#Creating components with scripting

Scripting (or creating scripts) is writing your own additions to the Unity Editor's functionality in code, using the [Unity Scripting API](CreatingAndUsingScripts).

When you create a script and attach it to a __GameObject__, the script appears in the __GameObject's__ __Inspector__ just like a built-in __component__. This is because scripts become __components__ when you save them in your project.

In technical terms, any script you make compiles as a type of __component__, so the Unity Editor treats your script like a built-in component. You define the members of the script to be exposed in the Inspector, and the Editor executes whatever functionality you've written.

Read more about creating and using scripts in the [Scripting](CreatingAndUsingScripts) section of this User Manual.
