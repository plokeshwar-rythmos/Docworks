# Timeline

![Unity's Timeline](../uploads/Main/timeline_splash.png)

Use Unity's Timeline to create cinematic content, game-play sequences, audio sequences, and complex particle effects.

Each cut-scene, cinematic, or game-play sequence that you create with Unity's Timeline consists of a Timeline Asset and a Timeline instance. The [Timeline Editor window](TimelineEditorWindow) creates and modifies Timeline Assets and Timeline instances simultaneously. 

The [Timeline Overview section](TimelineOverview) includes details on the relationship between the Timeline Editor window, Timeline Assets, and Timeline instances.

The [Timeline Workflows section](TimelineWorkflows) shows how to create Timeline Assets and Timeline instances, how to record basic animation, and how to create cinematics.
