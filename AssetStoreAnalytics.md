# Setting up Google Analytics

##What is Google Analytics?

Google Analytics is a web-based information center that displays statistics on websites and web pages. As a publisher, you may have seen the __Tracking ID__ text field under the info tab of your Asset Store __Publisher Administration__ section.


##How do I set it up?

**1. Sign in or sign up**

Go to the [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) home page, and sign in with your Gmail account.

**2. Create a new Google Analytics account**

In Google Analytics, a "new account" refers to a new link or URL that you want to track. If this is the first time you have logged into Google Analytics, the site prompts you to do this automatically.

To create a new account, go to **Admin** > **Accounts** > **New Account**.

**3. New account form**

The Google Analytics new account form asks you to add a website URL.

Here, you need to enter the Short URL for your asset. To find the Short URL, click the name of your asset in the __Packages__ tab of the Asset Store Publisher Administration section and scroll to the bottom of the page:

**4. Tracking ID**

Creating a new account generates a Tracking ID. Copy the Tracking ID and paste it into the **Tracking ID** text field at the bottom of the **Info** tab in the Asset Store Publisher Administration section. For the **Loction Prefix**, you can choose to leave the default "/assetstore".
