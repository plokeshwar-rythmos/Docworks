#Universal Windows Platform: IL2CPP scripting back end

IL2CPP is a fully-supported scripting back end that can be used as an alternative to .NET when building projects for Universal Windows Platform. When building a project using IL2CPP, Unity converts IL code from scripts and assemblies to C++ before creating a native binary. Refer to the Unity Manual page on [IL2CPP](IL2CPP) for more information.
