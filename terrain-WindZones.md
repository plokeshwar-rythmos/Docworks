#Wind Zones

You can create the effect of wind on your terrain by adding one or more objects with __Wind Zone__ components. Trees within a wind zone will bend in a realistic animated fashion and the wind itself will move in pulses to create natural patterns of movement among the tree.

##Using Wind Zones
A wind zone object can be created directly (menu: __GameObject &gt; 3D Object &gt; Wind Zone__) or you can add the component to any suitable object already in the scene (menu: __Component > Miscellaneous > Wind Zone__). The inspector for the wind zone has a number of options to control its behaviour.

The _Mode_ can be set to _Directional_ or _Spherical_. In _Directional_ mode, the wind will affect the whole terrain at once while a _Spherical_ wind blows outwards within a sphere defined by the _Radius_ property. Directional winds are more useful for creating natural movement of the trees while spherical winds are more suitable for special effects like explosions.

The _Main_ property determines the overall strength of the wind but this can be given a little random variation using _Turbulence_. As mentioned above, the wind blows over the trees in pulses to create a more natural effect. The strength of the pulses and the time interval between them can be controlled using the _Pulse Magnitude_ and _Pulse Frequency_ properties.

##Particle Systems
The main use of wind is to animate trees but it can also affect particles generated by a particle system using the _External Forces_ module. See the reference page for [Particle Systems](class-ParticleSystem) for further details.
