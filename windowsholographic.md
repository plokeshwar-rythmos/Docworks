Windows Holographic is a mixed reality platform developed by Microsoft, built around the API of Windows 10. It works by enabling applications in which the live presentation of physical real-world elements is incorporated with that of virtual elements known as "holograms", so that they appear to exist together in a shared environment.

To learn more, see Microsoft's [Windows Mixed Reality](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/) documentation. This section contains all documentation regarding using Windows Holographic with Unity.
