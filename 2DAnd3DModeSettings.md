#2D and 3D Mode Settings

When creating a new project, you can specify whether to start the Unity Editor in 2D mode or 3D mode. However, you also have the option of switching the editor between 2D Mode and 3D Mode at any time. You can read more about [the difference between 2D and 3D projects here](2Dor3D). This page provides information about how to switch modes, and what exactly changes within the editor when you do.

##Switching Between 3D and 2D Modes
To change modes between 2D or 3D mode:

1. Bring up to the __Editor Settings Inspector__, via the __Edit>Project Settings>Editor__ menu. 
2. Then set  __Default Behavior Mode__ to either __2D__ or __3D__. 

You can find out more about the __Editor Settings Inspector__ on the [Editor Settings](class-EditorManager) page.
