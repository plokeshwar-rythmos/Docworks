To start working with Perforce in Unity, do the following:

<a name="AnchorTest"></a>

1. Setup or sync a workspace on your computer using a standard Perforce client such as _'perforce p4v_'. Refer to [perforce documentation](http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4v-gs/01_p4v-gs.html) to learn how to do this.
1. Copy an existing project into the workspace or start Unity and create a new project in the workspace.
1. Open the project and go to the __Edit-&gt;Project Settings-&gt;Editor__ menu.
1. Choose your __Mode__ according to the version control system that you chose.  
![](../uploads/Main/EditorVersionControlSettings.png)
1. Fill out your version control settings, such as username / password / server / workspace.
1. Keep __Automatic add__ checked if you want your files to be automatically added to version control when they're added to the project (or the folder on disk). Otherwise you will have to add new files manually.
1. Offline mode checkbox should be left off. Only use this if you know [how to work offline in Perforce without a Sandbox](http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4v/Offline.html).
1. You should select _Force Text_ as __Asset Serialization Mode__, so you can compare and merge files visually.
1. Click connect and verify that "Connected" is displayed above the connect button after a short while.
1. Use your standard perforce client (p4v) to make sure that all files in the Assets and ProjectSettings folders (including files ending with _.meta_) are added to Perforce.
