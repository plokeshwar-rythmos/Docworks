#Reflection Probe

A __Reflection Probe__ is rather like a camera that captures a spherical view of its surroundings in all directions. The captured image is then stored as a [Cubemap](class-Cubemap) that can be used by objects with reflective materials. Several reflection probes can be used in a given scene and objects can be set to use the cubemap produced by the nearest probe. The result is that the reflections on the object can change convincingly according to its environment.

##Properties

![](../uploads/Main/RefProbeInspector.png)

|**_Property:_** |**_Function:_** |
|:---|:---|
|__Type__ |Choose whether the probe is for a __Baked__, __Custom__ or __Realtime__ setup? |
|__Dynamic Objects__ | (__Custom__ type only) Forces objects not marked as __Static__ to be baked in to the reflection.|
|__Cubemap__ | (__Custom__ type only) Sets a custom [cubemap](class-Cubemap) for the probe.|
|__Refresh Mode__ | (__Realtime__ type only) Selects if and how the probe will refresh at runtime. The _On Awake_ option renders the probe only once when it first becomes active. _Every Frame_ renders the probe every frame update, optionally using __Time Slicing__ (see below). The __Via Scripting__ option refreshes the probe from a user script command rather than an automatic update. |
|__Time Slicing__ |  (__Realtime__ type only) How should the probe distribute its updates over time? The options are __All Faces At Once__ (spreads update over nine frames), __Individual Faces__ (updates over fourteen frames) and __No Time Slicing__ (the update happens entirely within one frame). See below for further details. |
|**Runtime settings**||
|__Importance__ |The degree of "importance" of this probe compared to its neighbours. Higher values indicate greater importance; more important probes will have priority over less important one in cases where an object is within range of two or more probes. This setting also affects the **Blending**, explained [here](UsingReflectionProbes). |
|__Intensity__ |The intensity modifier that is applied to the texture of this probe in its shader. |
|__Box Projection__ |Check this box to enable projection for reflection UV mappings. |
|__Box Size__ |The size of the box in which the reflection will be applied to the GameObject. The value is not affected by the Transform of the GameObject. Also used by __Box Projection__. |
|__Box Offset__ |The center of the box in which the reflections will be applied to the GameObject. The value is relative to the position of the GameObject. Also used by __Box Projection__. |
|**Cubemap capture settings**||
|__Resolution__ |The resolution of the captured reflection image. |
|__HDR__ |Should High Dynamic Range rendering be enabled for the cubemap? This also determines whether probe data is saved in [OpenEXR](http://www.openexr.com/) or PNG format. |
|__Shadow Distance__ |Distance at which shadows are drawn when rendering the probe. |
|__Clear Flags__ |Option to specify how empty background areas of the cubemap will be filled. The options are __Skybox__ and __Solid Color__. |
|__Background__ |Background colour to which the reflection cubemap is cleared before rendering. |
|__Culling Mask__ |Allows objects on specified layers to be included or excluded in the reflection. See the section about the Camera's culling mask on the [Layers](Layers) page. |
|__Use Occlusion Culling__ |Should occlusion culling be used when baking the probe? |
|__Clipping Planes__ |Near and far clipping planes of the probe's "camera". |


##Details

There are two buttons at the top of the __Reflection Probe__ Inspector window that are used for editing the __Size__ and __Probe Origin__ properties directly within the Scene. With the leftmost button (__Size__) selected, the probe's zone of effect is shown in the scene as a yellow box shape with handles to adjust the box's size.

The other button (__Origin__) allows you to drag the probe's origin relative to the box. Note that the origin handle resembles the [Transform](class-Transform) position handle but the two positions are not the same. Also, the rotation and scale operations are not available for the probe box.

The probe's __Type__ property determines how the reflection data is created and updated:

* __Baked__ probes store a static reflection cubemap generated by baking in the editor.
* __Custom__ probes store a static cubemap which can either be generated by baking or set manually by the user.
* __Realtime__ probes update the cubemap at runtime and can therefore react to dynamic objects in the scene.

To make use of the reflection cubemap, an object must have the __Reflection Probes__ option enabled on its [Mesh Renderer](class-MeshRenderer) and also be using a shader that supports reflection probes. When the object passes within the volume set by the probe's __Size__ and __Probe Origin__ properties, the probe's cubemap will be applied to the object.

You can also manually set which reflection probe to use for a particular object using the settings on the object's [Mesh Renderer](class-MeshRenderer). To do this, select one of the options for the Mesh Renderer's __Reflection Probes__ property (__Simple__, __Blend Probes__ or __Blend Probes and Skybox__) and drag the chosen probe onto its __Anchor Override__ property.

See the [Reflection Probes](ReflectionProbes) section in the manual for further details about principles and usage.
