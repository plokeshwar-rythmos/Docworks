#Building and using plug-ins for Android

You can use plug-ins developed for Android to call Java and C++ code created outside of Unity from your C# scripts, allowing you to access features like OS calls and third-party code libraries that would otherwise not be available to Unity. For more information about using plug-ins with Unity, see documentation on plug-ins.

The following pages describe the process of creating your own plug-ins for use in Android projects. The information on these pages assumes the reader knows how to create native plug-ins for use in Unity. For more information about native plug-ins and their uses, see documentation on [native plug-ins](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/NativePlugins.html)


Unity supports several types of Android plug-ins:

* [AAR plug-ins and Android Libraries](AndroidAARPlugins)

* [JAR plug-ins](AndroidJARPlugins)

* [Extending the UnityPlayerActivity Code](AndroidUnityPlayerActivity)

* [Native (C++) plug-ins](AndroidNativePlugins)
