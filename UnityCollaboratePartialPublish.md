# Publishing individual files to Collaborate

Colloborate allows you to partially *publish* a Project. A partial publish allows you to publish only those files that you are ready to share with the rest of the team or just save work to the cloud for safekeeping. So, instead of publishing all the changed Assets in a Project, you can publish specific Project to [Collaborate](UnityCollaborate).  

To publish specific Assets:

1. In the Unity Editor, with your Project open, right-click on the new or modified [Asset](AssetWorkflow), sets of Assets, or folder to publish.
2. Select __Collaborate__ > __Publish__.
