# Tilemap

The Tilemap feature allows you to quickly create 2D levels using tiles and a grid overlay. It is comprised of a number of systems working together:

* __Tile__ Assets
* __Grid__ GameObjects
* The __Tilemap Palette__
* Custom __Brushes__

This section documents how to use each part of the Tilemap system.
