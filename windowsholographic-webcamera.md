#Web Camera
<!-- https://trello.com/c/Qw7imxOL -->
The Web Camera API is an asynchronous API that provides the ability to take pictures and record videos.  The Web Camera is a shared resource. This means that only one `PhotoCapture` or `VideoCapture` instance can be activated at any given time. You can query what the current mode is using the [WebCam.Mode](ScriptRef:XR.WSA.WebCam.WebCam.Mode.html) property.
