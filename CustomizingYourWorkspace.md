Customizing Your Workspace
--------------------------


You can customize your __Layout__ of Views by click-dragging the Tab of any View to one of several locations. Dropping a Tab in the __Tab Area__ of an existing window will add the Tab beside any existing Tabs. Alternatively, dropping a Tab in any __Dock Zone__ will add the View in a new window.

Tabs can also be detached from the Main Editor Window and arranged into their own floating Editor Windows. Floating Windows can contain arrangements of Views and Tabs just like the Main Editor Window.

When you've created a Layout of Editor Windows, you can Save the layout and restore it any time. You do this by expanding the Layout drop-down (found on the Toolbar) and choosing __Save Layout...__. Name your new layout and save it, then restore it by simply choosing it from the Layout drop-down.

At any time, you can right-click the tab of any view to view additional options like Maximize or add a new tab to the same window.
