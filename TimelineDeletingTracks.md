### Deleting tracks

Delete a track to remove the track, its clips, blends, and properties from the Timeline Editor window. This is a destructive action that modifies a Timeline Asset and affects all Timeline instances based on the Timeline Asset. To delete a track, Right-click the track and select __Delete__ from the context menu.

Deleting an Animation track also deletes the recorded Infinite clips for Animation clips that were converted from Infinite clips.

The Project window may still show Infinite clips as children of a Timeline Asset since it is not updated until after the scene or project is saved.
