# Facebook Player Settings

This page details the __Player Settings__ specific to the Facebook platform. A description of the general Player Settings can be found [here](class-PlayerSettings).

Note that the Facebook build target is utilizing the existing [WebGL](class-PlayerSettingsWebGL) and Windows [Standalone](class-PlayerSettingsStandalone) build targets, so the Player Settings for those targets will also apply.
