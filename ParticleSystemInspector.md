The Particle System Inspector (Shuriken)
----------------------------------------

The __Particle System Inspector__ shows one particle system at a time (the currently selected one), and it looks like this:

Individual particle systems can take on various complex behaviors by using [Modules](ParticleSystemModulesIntro).

They can also be extended by being grouped together into __Particle Effects__. 

If you press the button __Open Editor ...__, this will open up the Extended __Particle Editor__, that shows all of the particle systems under the same root in the scene tree. For more information on particle system grouping, see the section on [Particle Effects](ParticleSystemGrouping).
