Setup
============

To start working with Unity Wii U you will need following:

1. Windows 7 64bit / Windows 8 64bit
1. CAT-DEV (Development System)
1. CAFE SDK 2.12.12 or later
1. TV / External Monitor
1. MULTI 5.3.23 or later


After installing the **Unity Editor** please install the **Wii U Support Add-on**. 

Unity Wii U requires CAFE SDK and MULTI installed and set up to build applications for the Wii U.
The editor picks up CAFE SDK and MULTI paths from environment variables _CAFE\_ROOT_ and _GHS\_ROOT_ respectively.

Alternatively, CAFE SDK and MULTI paths can be set or overridden in "Edit -> Preferences -> External Tools" section in the Editor.


## Automated Install

You can install Unity without user intervention by specifying the **/S** command line option. The default install location can be changed with **/D=&lt;path&gt;**, which must be the last argument and the path name must be written without quotes even if it contains spaces.
