How to contribute to Unity
============
A guide for open-source contributers
-------------------

This guide provides help and support for Unity users who may not have participated in an open-source project before. 

Unity uses [distributed version control](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/How+is+DVCS+different+from+other+version+control+systems) to version open-source components. Essentially, this means that you make changes and contribute them back through a process of "forking" our repository, cloning your "fork", pushing your changes to your "fork", and then opening a pull request for us to review. 

This guide includes an example walkthrough to help make this process clearer. Please also see the [Further Reading](ContributingReading) section and the [FAQ](ContributingFAQ) section to learn more about open-source contributions to Unity.
