Debugging
=========


###What is not available?

* You can't debug managed code with MonoDevelop due couple of reasons:
    * Wii player uses Mono library for consoles which doesn't have the necessary changes for the debugger to work.
    * For the debugger to work the network connection is required between the PC and the NDEV kit, only wireless connection is available, though at the moment it's not clear if it's possible to adapt connection like this for debugger needs.
* You can't use Unity Editor profiler with Wii player due above mentioned network connection limitation, though in the near future it should be possible to use Nintendo Wii Profiler.

###Most of the debugging features are only available when the wii player is built with "Development Build" checkbox on (in Build Settings).

###Debugging with development player:


* Additional files:
&gt; When you build the development player, you get additionally two files in &lt;ProjectFolder&gt;\Pacakge :

    * UnityWii.map;
    * UnityWii.minimap (preparsed version of UnityWii.map and is used by the development player when crash occurs to output stactraces with resolved function names instead of addresses);

###Special keys:


|**_Key_** |**_Description||_** |
|:---|:---|
|Hold 1 + Press B on the first Wii Controller.|Outputs the memory statistics|
|Hold 2 + Press B on the first Wii Controller.|Enters memory debugging mode|

ErrorHandler: It seems crash occured in Mono, try to output exception:

Unhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object


````

It was produced by the following code:



````
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class ScriptNullRef : MonoBehaviour 
{
     void Func1()
     {
        MonoBehaviour b = null;
        Debug.Log("1");
        b.ToString(); // DSI exception occurs here..
        Debug.Log("2");
     }
     void Start () 
     {
        Func1();
     }
     void Update ()
     {
     }
}


````

Most common exceptions:

* DSI exception (0x00300) - the data memory access cannot be performed, for ex., when trying to read from NULL pointer.
* ISI exception (0x00400) - an attempt to fetch the next instruction to be executed fails, for ex., function pointer is NULL, and you're trying to call that function.
* FPE exception (0x00800) - floating point exception, for ex., division by zero **(Note: this will be disabled in the builds which are released after 2011-03-30, because floating point exceptions shouldn't make the program crash, only the warning message will be outputted in the log)**

When exception occurs, the development player tries to open UnityWii.minimap and tries to resolve the stacktrace.
There are two types of functions in Unity Wii:

* JIT (Just-In-Time) functions - produced by mono whenever you're calling managed code function for the first time, these functions cannot be resolved using the UnityWii map files, and if you're using the CodeWarrior for debugging, you will only see hex addresses in the stactrace. Development player resolves these functions using a special mono function.
* Native code functions - simple c/c++ functions, you can find all of these functions in the UnityWii.map.

It's easy to distinguish which function is which by just looking at the function description:

1. JIT function - "ErrorHandler: 0x808c28f8: 0x808c2918 0x80c4c9e4 ScriptNullRef:Func1 () + 0x28 (IL Offset: 0xc) (0x80c4c9bc 0x80c4ca24) [0x90027300 - Unity Root Domain]"
1. Simple function - "ErrorHandler: 0x808c2998: 0x808c29d8 0x804bb91c mono_jit_runtime_invoke"

If the exception occurs in the managed code, you can find the exact code location where it occurred - meaning the exact instruction:

* Open ildasm.exe (usually it's located in \Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Bin).
* Locate Assembly-CSharp.dll, it's should be located in &lt;ProjectFolder&gt;\Pacakge\Data\Managed folder, and all of your C# code goes there.
* Drag Assembly-CSharp.dll on top of the ildasm.exe, you should see something like this now:

&gt; ![](../uploads/Main/disam1.jpg)
&gt; We know that DSI exception occurred in ScriptNullRef:Func1, double-click on it:

&gt; ![](../uploads/Main/disam2.jpg)

&gt; Remember the output of the crash handler - "ErrorHandler: Crash occured in 0x80c4c9ec: ScriptNullRef:Func1 () + 0x30 **(IL Offset: 0xc)** (0x80c4c9bc 0x80c4ca24) [0x90027300 - Unity Root Domain]".
&gt; So the crash occurred near - "IL_000c: ldloc.0".
