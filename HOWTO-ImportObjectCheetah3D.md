Importing Objects From Cheetah3D
================================


Unity natively imports Cheetah3D files. To get started, simply place your **.jas** file in your project's Assets folder.
When you switch back into Unity, the scene is imported automatically and will show up in the __Project View__.

To see your model in Unity, simply drag it from the Project View into the __Scene View__.

If you modify your **.jas** file, Unity will automatically update whenever you save.
