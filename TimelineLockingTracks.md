### Locking tracks

Lock a track to lock editing of the track and any of the clips used by the track.

Use lock when the animation on a track is completed and you want to avoid inadvertently modifying the track. A locked track cannot be edited and its clips cannot be selected. The Lock icon identifies a locked track.

__Note:__ Locked tracks can still be deleted.
