#ShaderLab: Fallback

After all Subshaders a Fallback can be defined. It basically says "if none of subshaders can run on this hardware, try using the ones from another shader".


##Syntax

````
	Fallback "name"
````
Fallback to shader with a given _name_ or...


````
	Fallback Off
````
Explicitly state that there is no fallback and no warning should be printed, even if no subshaders can run on this hardware.


##Details

A fallback statement has the same effect as if all subshaders from the other shader would be inserted into its place.


##Example

````
	Shader "example" {
	    // properties and subshaders here...
	    Fallback "otherexample"
	}
````
