# Scenes

Scenes contain the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.

When you create a new Unity project, your scene view displays a new Scene. This Scene is *untitled* and *unsaved*. The Scene is empty except for a Camera (called __Main Camera__) and a Light (called __Directional Light__).

##Saving Scenes

To save the Scene you're currently working on, choose __File__ &gt; __Save Scene__ from the menu, or press Ctrl + S (Windows) or Cmd + S (masOS). 

Unity saves Scenes as Assets in your project's _Assets_ folder. This means they appear in the Project window, with the rest of your Assets.

##Opening Scenes

To open a Scene in Unity, double-click the Scene Asset in the Project window. You must open a Scene in Unity to work on it.

If your current Scene contains unsaved changes, Unity asks you whether you want to save or discard the changes.

##Multi-Scene editing

It is possible to have multiple Scenes open for editing at one time. For more information about this, see documentation on [Multi-Scene editing](MultiSceneEditing).
