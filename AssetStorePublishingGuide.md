Asset Store Publishing Guide
======================

Creating a Publisher Account
-----


Visit the [Publisher Administration](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/) page and log in with your Unity Account. If you are not already a Publisher, you will be prompted to create an Asset Store Publisher Account. Fill out the form and save the data to create your account. Unless otherwise noted, the information you provide will be displayed on the Asset Store on your customer-facing Publisher Page ([*Example*](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/publisher/1950)).

Creating a new package
-----

The first thing you want to do if you are ready to submit an asset is to create a draft for your package. Go to the Packages tab of your [Publisher Administration](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/packages.html) page and click the button *"Create New Package"*

**Icon & Key Image Sizes:**

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Icon:** | 128 x 128 (*pixels*)|
| **Small:** | 200 x 258 (*pixels*) |
| **Large:** | 860 x 389 (*pixels*) |

**Eye Catching:**
These key images must aim to capture the eyes of customers just as a colorful cartoon captures the eyes of children. A lot of customers browse on the asset store and can commonly buy under impulse. Your Key images must help your asset stand out.

Icon Images:

The Icon Image is the most common key image that users will see. Here are a few well made icon images from the asset store as examples:

Adding Screenshots
-----
You can change the screenshots attached to your asset by clicking the Edit link below the ***"Screenshots"*** tab under **Metadata & Artwork**.

Click the **"Insert Image"** button in order to upload the image and add it as a screenshot for your asset. You can add multiple screenshots this way. Remove a screenshot by clicking the **"Remove"** button next to the image you wish to remove.

The **"Up"** and **"Down"** buttons allow you to put your screenshots into any order you like.

**How screenshots :**

Screenshots are just as important as key images when trying to sell your asset. Your asset may be the best asset in the world, however, if your screenshots do not communicate that then it will not sell.
