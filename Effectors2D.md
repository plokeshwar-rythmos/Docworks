# Effectors 2D

Use Effector 2D [components](UsingComponents) with [Collider 2D](Collider2D) components to direct the forces of [physics](PhysicsSection) in your project when [GameObject](GameObjects) colliders come into contact with each other. 

You can use Effector 2D components to create the following effects (among others):

* Create 'platform' behaviour such as one-way collisions ([PlatformEffector2D](class-PlatformEffector2D))
* Create conveyor belts ([SurfaceEffector2D](class-SurfaceEffector2D))
* Attract or repulse against a given source point ([PointEffector2D](class-PointEffector2D))
* Make GameOjects float ([BuoyancyEffector2D](class-BuoyancyEffector2D))
* Randomly vary force and angle magnitude ([class-AreaEffector2D](class-AreaEffector2D))
