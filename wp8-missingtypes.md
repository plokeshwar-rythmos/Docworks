# Windows Phone 8: Missing .NET Types

On Windows Phone 8 Microsoft .NET is used instead of Mono. There is a special .NET version for this platform, which is not entirely compatible with Mono.

The issues encountered due to incompatibility are mostly the same as in Windows Store Apps. For solution, please, refer to [this page](windowsstore-missingtypes).
