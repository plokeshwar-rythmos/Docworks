Playstation3: Controllers
=========================


Unity for PS3 takes advantage of all the official controllers : Pad, Move and Navigation.

To query button states:

* Call _Input.GetKey*()_ with a _KeyCode_. See table for reference.
    * e.g: Use Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Joystick1Button0) to see if Button 0 of the Pad 1 is pressed.
* Call _Input.GetButton*()_ with a name set in the _InputManager_.
    * Joystick 0 button names are formed as "joystick button #".
    * Joystick 1-11 button names are formed as "joystick # button #" (Joysticks 1 through 7 represent **PAD** controllers while Joysticks 8 through 11 represent **MOVE** controllers)
To query analog axis values:

* Call Input.GetAxis*() with a name set in the InputManager.
* _Axis 3_ is "_Axis 9_ minus _Axis 10_" for backwards compatibility.
* _Axis 8_ is not used.

###Vibration Features

To start a pad vibrating, call [PS3Pad.SetVibration](ScriptRef:PS3Pad.SetVibration.html) and to stop it call [PS3Pad.StopVibration](ScriptRef:PS3Pad.StopVibration).

###Gyroscope Features

To read the gyroscope information of the DUALSHOCKÂ®3 controller, call the following functions:

* [PS3Pad.GetSensorPitch](ScriptRef:PS3Pad.GetSensorPitch.html)
* [PS3Pad.GetSensorRoll](ScriptRef:PS3Pad.GetSensorRoll.html)
* [PS3Pad.GetSensorData](ScriptRef:PS3Pad.GetSensorData.html)

###Move & Navigation controllers:


* The buttons & analog sticks are accessed through the default Unity [Input](ScriptRef:Input.html) API just like the Pad controller.
* You can access the Playstation 3 Move controller sphere/handle rotation, position and sphere tracking via the [PS3Move](ScriptRef:PS3Move.html) API provided in the scripts.
* If you want to display the camera texture (for calibration) you can access it via the **\_PS3CameraTexture** sampler2D inside the shader.
