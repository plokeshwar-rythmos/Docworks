This section contains documentation for users developing 2D games in Unity. Note that many areas of the Unity documentation apply to both 2D and 3D development; this section focuses solely on 2D-specific features and functionality.

See documentation on [2D and 3D mode settings](2DAnd3DModeSettings) for information on how to change the 2D/3D mode how the modes differ. See [2D or 3D Projects](2Dor3D) if you're not sure whether you should be working in 2D or 3D.
