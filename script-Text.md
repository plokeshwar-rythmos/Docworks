#Text

The __Text__ control displays a non-interactive piece of text to the user. This can be used to provide captions or labels for other GUI controls or to display instructions or other text.

##Details

Some controls (such as [Buttons](script-Button) and [Toggles](script-Toggle)) have textual descriptions built-in. For controls that have no implicit text (such as [Sliders](script-Slider)), you can indicate the purpose using a label created with a Text control. Text is also useful for lists of instructions, story text, conversations and legal disclaimers.

The Text control offers the usual parameters for font size, style, etc, and text alignment. When the _Rich Text_ option is enabled, markup elements within the text will be treated as styling information, so you can have just a single word or short section in boldface or in a different color, say (see the page about [Rich Text](StyledText) for details of the markup scheme).


##Hints

* See the [Effects](comp-UIEffects) page for how to apply a simple shadow or outline effect to the text.
