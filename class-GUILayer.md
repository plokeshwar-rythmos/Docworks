GUI Layer (Legacy)
=========

**Please Note:** *This component relates to legacy methods for drawing UI textures and images to the screen. You should use Unity's up-to-date [UI system](UISystem) instead. This is also unrelated to the [IMGUI system](GUIScriptingGuide).*

A __GUI Layer__ Component is attached to a Camera to enable rendering of 2D GUIs.

When a GUI Layer is attached to a Camera it will render all [GUI Textures](class-GUITexture) and [GUI Texts](class-GUIText) in the scene. GUI Layers do not affect [UnityGUI](GUIScriptingGuide) in any way.

You can enable and disable rendering GUI in a single camera by clicking on the check box of the GUI Layer in the __Inspector__.
