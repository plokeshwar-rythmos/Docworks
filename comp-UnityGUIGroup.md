UnityGUI Group (Legacy)
==============


__UnityGUI__ is the GUI creation system built into Unity. It consists of creating different __Controls__, and defining the content and appearance of those controls.

The __Components__ of UnityGUI allow you to define the appearance of Controls.


For information about using UnityGUI to create Controls and define their content, please read the [GUI Scripting Guide](GUIScriptingGuide).
