#Creating submittable packages

##__PS4 package files overview__

 

PS4 Packages (.PKG files) contain content, based on how they were created:

 

* Application Packages

*  Patches

*  Day-One Patches

*  Remaster

*  Additional Content (DLC)

 

All but the Remaster package can be created within Unity.

 

Packages can all be installed on a PS4 via PS4 Neighbourhood (select "Install Package" under the “Target Operations” section).

Also note that it is possible to install packages via the command line, using the *orbis-run.exe* tool. See here for more information: [https://ps4.scedev.net/resources/documents/SDK/latest/Neighborhood_and_Utilities-Users_Guide/0004.html](https://ps4.scedev.net/resources/documents/SDK/4.000/Neighborhood_and_Utilities-Users_Guide/0004.html)

 

Full information regarding each format is in the official SDK documentation, under "*Production and Distribution Guide*" > “*Package Types*”

 

To create any type of package (other than Additional Content) from within Unity, set File > Build Settings > Build Type to "*PS4 Package*".

## __Application package__

 

An Application Package contains everything that should be within the released title.

 

If future patching or DLC (Downloadable Content) is expected, it is important to consider the implications of doing so at the earliest stage. For example, using AssetBundles would allow for DLC content to be created and installed within a title at a future date.

 

## __Creating application package files__

Use the following steps to build an Application Package:

1.  Select __BuildingSettings > PlayerSettings > Publishing Settings__ and set:

     1. *Category *(select "*PS4 Application*")

     2. *Application Type* (select "*Paid Standalone Full App (full)*")

2. Set the *Master Version*:

     1. Although the application version ("APP_VER") for the initial release will always be 1.00, the master version (“VERSION”) may be a number greater than this. For example, if a title is submitted to QA for testing but unfortunately fails, the second version that is sent to QA could use a different master version value to ensure that there is no confusion about which is the latest version prior to release.

3. Set the *Content ID*:

    1. See section: Content ID

## __Content ID__

The *Content ID *is split into multiple parts. See the Sony [*Publishing Tools Overview: Packages](https://ps4.scedev.net/resources/documents/Misc/current/Publishing_Tools-Overview/0003.html)* document (*Service ID* section) for full details


![](../uploads/Main/SubmittablePackages1.png)


All packages of any type for a single application must have the same Service ID

 A Service ID is issued by Sony after making a request on the PlayStation®4 DevNet website.

## __Patches__

A patch may be created for a number of reasons. For example:

* Overwrite existing files (fixing textures or to fix code bugs…)

* Add new files (include new graphics or audio to enhance the game…)

 

 

## __changeinfo.xml__

Patches require a changeinfo.xml file (and potentially changeinfo_nn.xml files).

 

These contain update information that is used for displaying the update content when a game is updated with a patch. With update information, users can view the update content of all installed patches in the Update History screen that can be accessed from the home screen.




 

The build process handles multilingual changeinfo files. For example, changeinfo_00.xml should be used for Japanese content. However, changeinfo.xml is always required by default.

 

See the Sony documentation for more details: [https://ps4.scedev.net/resources/documents/SDK/latest/Content_Information-Specifications/0010.html](https://ps4.scedev.net/resources/documents/SDK/4.000/Content_Information-Specifications/0010.html)

These files have strict requirements:

* XML format text file

* UTF-8

* No BOM (Byte Order Mark)

* The linefeed code is LF

 

As such, care should be taken when creating these files, such as using a text editor or a tool such as ‘dos2unix’ or ‘Notepad++’ to format the text correctly.

 Also note that the changeinfo.xml file needs to be placed within a folder that contains nothing else.

Building patches with incorrect a changeinfo file, such not following the strict formatting or folder requirements, can result in the package build failing, such as the pkg building OK, but the required .xml and .txt files are not generated. Such a fail has results in very little output log information as to why the package failed. However, verifying the package the orbis-pub-chk.exe tool (see* Verifying packages* section), can be used to highlight the problematic area.

 

See the Sony documentation for more details: [Content Information Specifications: Update Information](https://ps4.scedev.net/resources/documents/SDK/latest/Content_Information-Specifications/0010.html)

 

__Creating patch package files__

 

Patch package files are created in a very similar way to Application Packages:

 

1. Select __BuildSettings > PlayerSettings > Publishing Settings__ and set the following:
    

    1.   	*Category* – Select "PS4 Application Patch".

    2.      *Application Type* - Select "Paid Standalone Full App (full)"

    3.   	*Application PKG* - Select the Application .pkg file that was initially created.

    4.  	*Patch ChangeInfo Folder*__ __– Select the folder that contains the changeinfo.xml file(s)

    5.   	*Latest QA Passed PKG* - Leave blank if this is the first patch. Otherwise, select the last released patch .pkg file.

    6.        *Application Version* - must be incremental for each patch.

    7.   	*Content ID* – This must be the Application .pkg content ID. See *Content Restrictions*

    8.  	Ensure that the "Day One Patch" tick box is not set

 

__Note 1:__ Selecting an Application .pkg as the "Latest QA Passed PKG", will cause an error during the build process:

 

[Error]	The following combination of Volume Type/Storage Type is not allowed or not supported. (app:digital50, patch:unknown, patch:digital25)

 

__Note 2: __When the Publishing Settings > Category is set to "PS4 Application Patch", the “Build & Run” button in the “Build Settings” dialog will be disabled.

__Note 3: Content ID Restrictions__

For patch package/remaster package Content ID labels must exactly match the corresponding application package Content ID label.

For additional content, Content ID labels of additional content packages must be different from the corresponding application package Content ID label. In addition, the Content ID labels of additional content packages for the same application package must be different from each other.

__Note 4: Day One Patch tick box__

Please note that the Day One Patch tick box was introduced in Unity version 5.4. Versions prior to this will not contain the Day One Patch tick box. However, the resulting patch that is created will always be created as Day One. This means that the resulting file size that will be uploaded by the player will be larger than necessary, as no delta compression will be applied to the patch file. 

## __Day one patch package files__

Day one patch files are only required if the patch is to be released on the same day as the master application package

 

The difference between day one and normal patch files is that normal patch files incorporate delta processing on the Sony server side, so that minimal data needs to be transmitted to the user.

The only situation needing a day one patch is when the master application package is not finalized in GEMS. In order for delta patching to take place, the master package has to be finalized.
 

Creating Day One patch files requires the same process as when creating normal patch files. However, the "Day One Patch" tick box must also be selected.

For Day One patches, you should  leave  Latest QA Passed PKG blank, as the day one patch will always be the first patch.

## __Remaster patch__

 

Resmaster packages are not a common package type and Unity cannot be used to create one.  You will need to use the Sony provided tools to make a Remaster patch. Read the Sony documentation for deatils::[ https://ps4.scedev.net/resources/documents/SDK/latest/Patch_Remaster-Overview/0004.html](https://ps4.scedev.net/resources/documents/SDK/4.000/Patch_Remaster-Overview/0004.html)

 

## __Additional content (DLC)__

 

The standard method of creating DLC is to use [AssetBundles](AssetBundlesIntro). Using this method allows you to easily handle including the data from DLC within the Unity framework. Note, however, that script data (both C# or UnityScript) can NOT be placed within AssetBundles. Therefore, if extra script data is also required, a patch may also need to be additionally released prior to the DLC becoming available.

 

## __Creating DLC__

 

DLC can not be created via the [PlayerSettings](PS4ProjectSettings) within the Unity editor. There is a sample package  included as part of the Unity PS4Player add on ("AdditionalContentPackages" *Assets > Import Package > PS4 Samples*) that adds editor scripts to access Player Settings and create DLC through custom menu commands.

 

 

## __Modifying the "AdditionalContentPackages” for your own needs__

 

Once you have installed the AdditionalContentPackages sample, open the *Editor > ExportPS4DRMPackages.cs* file.

 

1) Set the *Service ID* and *passcode* correctly to match those you have set in the Unity Editor *Build Settings > Player Settings > Publisher Settings.*

 

2) Take a look at the example packages that will be created (the line that contains "static DRMPackageDesc []packages ="). Make the relevant changes so that this now contains your own files, etc. (see the comments for the *DRMPPackageDesc* structure within that file).

 

3) Icon0.png is also required!

The current version of the sample does not allow you to specify the DLC package icon. This will be fixed in a future revision. However, making the following changes to the code will allow you to then select the icon0.png file when the editor script is finally run.

 

The following code should be placed in ExportPS4DRMPackages.cs, before the line: foreach (DRMPackageDesc desc in packages)

(approx. line 80)

 

   	string stagingAreaSceSys = stagingArea + "/sce_sys";

    	Directory.CreateDirectory(stagingAreaSceSys);

    	string filePath = EditorUtility.OpenFilePanel("Select icon0.png", "", "png");

    	if (filePath.Length == 0)

    	{

        	return;

    	}

    	File.Copy(filePath, stagingAreaSceSys + "/icon0.png", true);

Also, at around like 147 (after "fileNames/Add(paramSfo);", add the following:

fileNames.Add(stagingAreaSceSys+"/icon0.png");

## __Building the DLC package__

 

To create package(s), select *PS4Tools* from the Unity editor menu, and select *ExportDRMContentPackages*.

## __Verifying packages__

 

Use the orbis-pub-chk.exe tool to verify packages have no errors before submission. The default location of orbis-pub-chk.exe is *C:\Program Files (x86)\SCE\ORBIS\Tools\Publishing Tools\bin\.*

 

Run the tool, then  drag and drop the DLC package onto the opened window. This will display the package information, and can also highlight any errors.

 

Note that this tool can also be used to verify any PKG.

## __.PKG file names__

 

To create packages, Unity calls the tool *orbis-pub-cmd.exe* using the *img_create* parameter.

 

This tool also generates the package final filename:

 

*Content ID-Application Version – Master Version.pkg*

 

For example, the *Content ID* may be:

 *JP0000-CABCD00000_00-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*

 

The first Application release would be:

 *JP0000-CABCD00000_00-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-***_A0100-V0100_***.pkg*

 

Its first patch would be (note the same label too):

 *JP0000-CABCD00000_00-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-***_A0101-V0100_***.pkg*

 

Finally, as stated in the *Creating Application Package Files* section, the master version may not always be V1.00 (0100). If, for example, a title initially failed QA, the next version that may have passed might be set to V1.01. Therefore, the first application release would be:

 *UP0000-CUSA00000_00-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-***_A0100-V0101_***.pkg*
