# Light Explorer

The Light Explorer allows you to select and edit light sources. To open the Light Explorer from the menu, navigate to __Window__ > __Lighting__ > __Light Explorer__.

Use the four tabs at the top of the panel to view settings for the [Lights](LightSources), [Reflection Probes](class-ReflectionProbe), [Light Probes](LightProbes), and Static Emissives in the current Scene. The editable parameters are the most commonly-used fields for each component type. 

Use the search field to filter each table for names. You can also select the lights you want to work on, then tick the __Lock Selection__ checkbox. Only the lights that were selected when the checkbox was ticked remain listed in the Light Explorer, even if you select a different Light in the Scene.
