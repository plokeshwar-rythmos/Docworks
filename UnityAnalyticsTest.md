Play To Validate
===============
The Unity Editor can act as a test environment to validate Analytics integration. When you press the Play button, the Editor sends data which you can see in the validator below. This means that it is not required that you build and publish your game in order to validate Basic Integration.

Press Play
----------
To send test data to our servers and validate your integration, simply play your game by pressing the Play button. If integration is successful, your test data will display in the table below.

Note: The validator is instantaneous so your test data is available immediately. You need to wait up to six hours for the dashboard to aggregate and to show data.
