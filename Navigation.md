#Navigation and Pathfinding

![](../uploads/Main/NavMeshCover.png)

The navigation system allows you to create characters that can intelligently move around the game world, using navigation meshes that are created automatically from your Scene geometry. Dynamic obstacles allow you to alter the navigation of the characters at runtime, while off-mesh links let you build specific actions like opening doors or jumping down from a ledge. This section describes Unity's navigation and pathfinding systems in detail.
