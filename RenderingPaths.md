#Rendering Paths

Unity supports different *Rendering Paths*. You should choose which one you use depending on your game content and target platform / hardware. Different rendering paths have different performance characteristics that mostly affect Lights and Shadows. See [render pipeline](SL-RenderPipeline) for technical details.

The rendering path used by your project is chosen in [Graphics Settings](class-GraphicsSettings). Additionally, you can override it for each [Camera](class-Camera).

If the graphics card can't handle a selected rendering path, Unity will automatically use a lower fidelity one. For example, on a GPU that can't handle Deferred Shading, Forward Rendering will be used.


## Deferred Shading

*Deferred Shading* is the rendering path with the most lighting and shadow fidelity, and is best suited if you have many realtime lights. It requires a certain level of hardware support.

For more details see the [Deferred Shading page](RenderTech-DeferredShading).


## Forward Rendering

Forward is the traditional rendering path. It supports all the typical Unity graphics features (normal maps, per-pixel lights, shadows etc.). However under default settings, only a small number of the brightest lights are rendered in per-pixel lighting mode. The rest of the lights are calculated at object vertices or per-object.

For more details see the [Forward Rendering page](RenderTech-ForwardRendering).


## Legacy Deferred

*Legacy Deferred (light prepass)* is similar to Deferred Shading, just using a different technique with different trade-offs. It does not support the Unity 5 physically based standard shader.

For more details see the [Deferred Lighting page](RenderTech-DeferredLighting).


## Legacy Vertex Lit

*Legacy Vertex Lit* is the rendering path with the lowest lighting fidelity and no support for realtime shadows. It is a subset of Forward rendering path.

For more details see the [Vertex Lit page](RenderTech-VertexLit).

**NOTE:** *Deferred rendering is not supported when using Orthographic projection. If the camera's projection mode is set to Orthographic, these values are overridden, and the camera will always use Forward rendering.*
