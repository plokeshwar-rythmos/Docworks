##Details

A __Terrain__ can incorporate _wind zones_ which affect the movement of trees on the landscape. Enabling this section allows the wind zones to blow particles from the system. The _Multiplier_ value lets you scale the effect of the wind on the particles, since they will often be blown more strongly than tree branches.
