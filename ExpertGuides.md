The Expert Guides in this section are written by Unity's area experts in their own words. Here, Unity developers provide detailed insights into features and topics relevant to using Unity and how to get the most out of it. 

Some of these documents were blog posts written specificially by developers who want to get their knowledge into your hands directly. Because their length and format differs from the the User Manual's normal style, we provide them to you as downloadable PDFs or Google documents.

[**_De-Lighting in Unity_**](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/DeLightingTool/blob/master/Assets/DeLightingTool/Documentation/De-LightingTool.pdf)<br/>
__Author:__ Sébastien Lagarde, Developer - Rendering Research <br/>
__Date:__ 2017-10-20<br/>
__Checked with Unity version:__ 2017.1<br/>
__Synopsis:__ Photogrammetry is becoming more and more popular in the CG industry. Being able to use a regular camera as a powerful 3D scanner is now an essential tool when creating realistic 3D assets. However, when you generate raw textures in this way, they often contain a lot of lighting information that you should remove to obtain the true base color for rendering. This document shows you how to solve this problem using the Unity De-Lighting Tool.
