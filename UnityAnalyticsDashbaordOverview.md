# Overview tab 
The Overview tab of your Unity Analytics Dashboard provides a number of predefined charts that track commonly used metrics and key performance indicators. The overview tab presents the charts in the following sections:


|:---|:---|
|__Active Players__| Shows how many players start to play your game as well as return to it over time. |
|__Sessions__ | Shows how often and how long the average player plays your game each day. |
|__Retention__ | Shows the percentage of players who return to the game at significant intervals. |
|__Revenue__ | Shows reported, verified In-App Purchase (IAP) and Unity Ads revenue. |

For each chart displayed in these sections, you can select the date range to display. You can also click the __View in Data Explorer__ button to view the report in the [DataExplorer](UnityAnalyticsDataExplorer) tab where you have many more options for selecting, formatting, and analyzing report data.

For more information about the metrics used on the Overview tab and elsewhere on the Analytics Dashboard, see [Analytics Metrics, Segments, and Terminology](UnityAnalyticsTerminology).
