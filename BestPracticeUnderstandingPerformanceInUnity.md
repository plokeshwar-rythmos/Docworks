# Understanding optimization in Unity

This Best Practice Guide is a companion piece to the [Unite Unity Europe 2016](https://unite.unity.com) talk _Optimizing Mobile Applications_. It covers much of the same material, but with supplementary material added for the interested reader. You can watch the talk itself on YouTube: [Unite 2016: Optimizing Mobile Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4YAY36xjwE).

While the [Unite](https://unite.unity.com) talk implied that the covered topics might only be relevant to mobile performance, much of the talk was applicable to a general audience. Effort has been taken in this write-up to discuss information related to performance in a broad and platform-independent manner.
