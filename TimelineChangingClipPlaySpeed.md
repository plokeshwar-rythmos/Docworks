### Changing clip play speed

Change the play speed of clip speed to accelerate or decelerate its audio, motion, animation, or particle effect. Changing the clip play speed affects the duration of the clip. You can only change the play speed for Animation clips, Audio clips, and Control clips. For all other clip types, the Speed options are disabled.

In the Inspector window, the __Speed Multiplier__ property shows the play speed as a multiplier of the original clip speed. For example, changing the play speed of an 80 frame Animation clip to double speed changes the clip duration to 40 frames and sets the __Speed Multiplier__ to 2.

To change the clip play speed, Right-click a clip and select one of the following options:

* __Speed > Double Speed__ to halve the clip duration. The clip plays at twice its current speed. A short-dashed line and a multiplication factor indicates an accelerated clip. Doubling the clip speed sets the __Speed Multiplier__ property to double its current value. 

* __Speed > Half Speed__ to double the clip duration. The clip plays at half its current speed. A long-dashed line and multiplication factor indicates a decelerated clip. Halving the clip speed sets the __Speed Multiplier__ property to half its current value. 

* __Speed > Reset Speed__ to reset the clip to its original duration. The clip plays at its original speed. Resetting the clip speed sets the __Speed Multiplier__ property to 1.
