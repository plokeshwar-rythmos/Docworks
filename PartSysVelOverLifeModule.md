##Properties

|**Property** |**Function** |
|:---|:---|
|__X, Y, Z__ |Velocity in the X, Y and Z axes. |
|__Space__ |Selects whether the X, Y and Z axes refer to local or world space. |
|__Speed Modifier__ |Applies a multiplier to the speed of particles, along their current direction of travel. |

##Details

To create particles that drift in a particular direction, use the X, Y and Z curves.

To create an effect that adjusts the speed of particles, but does not affect which direction each particle travels in, use the __Speed Modifier__ curve.
