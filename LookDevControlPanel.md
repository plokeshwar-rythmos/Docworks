# Control panel

The __Control Panel__ gathers all the most commonly used settings in the Look Dev [Views menu](LookDevViewsMenus), for easy and fast access.

## Split-screen and Zone modes

In __Split-screen__ and __Zone__ mode, all properties are synchronized between the two views by default. Use the __lock__ button (highlighted in the image below) to make a property independent and applied only to the selected view (indicated by the blue or orange border around the border of the view).

Properties in the __Control Panel__ that only apply to one window are highlighted in the color of the selected view for further clarity.
