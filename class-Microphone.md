#Microphone

The __Microphone__ class is useful for capturing input from a built-in (_physical_) microphone on your PC or mobile device.

With this class, you can start and end a recording from a built-in microphone, get a listing of available audio input devices (microphones), and find out the status of each such input device. 

There is no component for the Microphone class but you can access it from a script. See the [Microphone](ScriptRef:Microphone.html) page in the Scripting Reference for further information.
