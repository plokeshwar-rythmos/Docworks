Publisher Administration
------------------------


Once you have your Publisher Account for the Asset Store set up, log into the Publisher Administration portal here: [https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/)

The Publisher Administration portal contains a number of tabs:


* **Sales** allows you to track all purchases made by customers, organised by package name. Quantity of Sales and Gross Revenue are shown here, as well as any refunds (if applicable).


* **Free Downloads** allows you track all packages you have published on the Asset Store for free, much the same as the Sales tab.


* **Revenue** shows your revenue for any given month since you started selling on the Asset Store. Credits, debits, your balance and recent payouts are shown here.


* **Pending** shows any outstanding packages you have submitted, that are pending approval from our Vetting Team, before being accepted for sale on the Asset Store.

* **Verify Invoice** allows you to verify a purchase using an invoice number - for example, if a customer has purchased on of your assets and needs support with it.


* **Users** allows you to add a number of administrative users (teammates, employees, colleagues) to your master account.


* **Payout** allows you to specify how you would like to receive your earnings. You can amend your payout details for the Asset Store at any point.
