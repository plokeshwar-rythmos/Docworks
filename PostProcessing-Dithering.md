## Dithering

The effect descriptions on this page refer to the default effects found within the post-processing stack. 

__Dithering __is the process of intentionally applying noise as to randomize [quantization error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_error). This prevents large-scale patterns such as color banding in images.
