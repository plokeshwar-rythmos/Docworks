Standard Assets
===============

Unity ships with multiple __Standard Assets__. These are collections of assets that are widely used by most Unity customers. These are: 2D, Cameras, Characters, CrossPlatformInput, Effects, Environment, ParticleSystems, Prototyping, Utility, Vehicles.  

Unity transfers __Standard Assets__ into and out of projects using Unity __packages__.

**Note:** If you chose not to install Standard Assets when you installed Unity, you can download them from the [Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32351).


##Importing Standard Assets

See [Asset Packages](AssetPackages) for information about installing (importing) __Standard Assets__, as well as sharing __Custom Packages__ between projects and via the __Asset Store__.

####Standard Assets Do Not Upgrade Automatically
When you create a new project in Unity, you can choose to include __Standard Assets__ collections in your project. Unity copies the assets you choose to include from the Unity install folder into your new project folder. This means that if you upgrade your Unity Editor to a newer version, the __Standard Assets__ you have already imported into your project do not upgrade: You have to manually upgrade them.

**HINT:** A newer version of a __Standard Asset__ might behave differently to your existing install (for performance or quality reasons, for example). A newer version might make your project look or behave differently and you may need to re-tweak its parameters. Check  the __package__ contents and Unity's release notes before you decide to re-install.
