# Adding team members to your Unity Project

[Unity Collaborate](UnityCollaborate) is part of Unity Teams. For each person you want to collaborate with, you must assign a Unity Teams seat for them in your organization. 

Unity Teams is available in two versions: 

* __Basic__, which gives you 3 free seats.

* __Advanced__, which gives you 3 seats after which you can purchase additional seats.

For more information on Unity Teams features, see the [Unity Teams homepage](https://unity3d.com/teams).

This page describes how to do the following:

* [Enable Collaborate for a team member](#EnableCollaborate)
* [Allow collaboration on all Projects in your organization](#AllowCollaborateAll)
* [Allow collaboration on individual Projects](#AllowCollaborateIndividual)
* [Manage team members in your organization](#ManageMembers)
* [Manage Unity Teams member access](#Collaborators)

## Unity Teams with Plus or Pro subscriptions

If you have Unity Teams through a Unity Plus or Pro subscription, every user that you assign a Plus/Pro seat to has Unity Teams access.

## Enable Collaborate for a team member

There are two ways to enable collaboration with your team members. You can:

* Allow collaboration on all Projects in your organization

* Allow collaboration on individual Projects

To add team members for either of these scenarios, you must be a Manager or Owner of the organization that the Projects are part of.

To learn how to verify your role within an organization, see [_Managing Your Organization_](#ManageMembers), below.

## Allow collaboration on all Projects in your organization

To give a team member access to all of the Projects in your organization that have Collaborate is enabled:

1. Make them an Owner or Manager of the organization. To learn how to do this, see [_Manage Your Organization_](#ManageMembers), below.

2. Give them access to Unity Teams. To learn how to do this, see [_Managing Collaborators in your organization_](#Collaborators), below.

For more information on enabling collaboration, see documentation on [Setting up Unity Collaborate](UnityCollaborateSettingUp).

When you click the __Invite Teammate__ icon, Unity launches the __Users__ section of the Unity Developer Dashboard in your browser. From the __Users__ section, you can invite anyone with a Unity ID to join your Project:

__Note__: You must tick __Also assign a Unity Teams Seat to this user__ to enable the user to use Collaborate on your Project.

To add the user as a guest in your organization, click __ADD__. This assigns a Unity Teams seat to the user.

When your team member has access to the Project, they can see the Project in their Launcher (__Projects__ > __In The Cloud__) and they can download the Project.
