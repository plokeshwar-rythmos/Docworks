# OctaneRender

<!-- This page is pending an edit and should not be in deleted or added to the ToC for now. --> 

OctaneRender is a GPU-accelerated path tracing renderer that creates photo-realistic images with global illumination and lighting accuracy that’s faithful to reality. Octane only supports standard Unity shaders out of the box. If you have a custom shader, you will need to write the equivalent shader in Octane.

You can import assets from a digital content creation (DCC) tool directly into Unity projects and scenes for real-time 3D editing. You can then arrange your Unity assets in Timeline to produce a sequence and then render it using the Octane viewport.

OctaneRender offers a node-based workflow for spectral lighting, mediums and materials. OctaneRender powers Unity’s live path-traced physically-based rendering (PBR) viewport for WYSIWYG final rendering in the Editor.

For advice on using OctaneRender and to get the latest package, visit [unity.otoy.com](https://unity.otoy.com/). To help you get started, the package also includes a collection of samples from the OctaneRender community. 

OctaneRender requires Unity 2017.1 or higher, Windows 7+ and a CUDA GPU (see [hardware requirements](https://help.otoy.com/hc/en-us/articles/214357103-Hardware-Suggestions)).
