## Post-processing stack

The post-processing stack is an Ã¼ber effect that combines a complete set of effects into a single post-processing pipeline. This has a few advantages:

* Effects are always configured in the correct order

* It allows a combination of many effects into a single pass

* All effects are grouped together in the UI for a better user experience

The post-processing stack also includes a collection of [monitors](PostProcessing-Monitors) and [debug views](PostProcessing-DebugViews) to help you set up your effects correctly and debug problems in the output.

You can download the post-processing stack from the [Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912).
