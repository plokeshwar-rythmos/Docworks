### Duplicating tracks

The Timeline Editor window supports the following different methods of duplicating tracks:

* Select a track. Right-click in an empty area in the Track list and select __Duplicate__ from the context menu.

* Select a track. Hold Command/Control and press D.

* Select a track. Hold Command/Control and press C. for copy, and press V for paste.

* Right-click a track and either select __Duplicate__ from the context menu or hold Command/Control and press D. 

Duplicating a track copies its clips, blends, and Inspector properties. If the duplicated track is bound to a GameObject, the binding is reset to None.
