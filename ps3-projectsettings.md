* **Trial mode**: Specifies whether the title is a trial or a full game.
The amount of memory reserved for MONO and for loading System Modules (SPRX) at runtime. The game scripts & mono runtime will allocate from this pool.
_Note: If the memory setting is too low you will see an error similar to this in the TTY console: prx.c:sys_prx_load_module:Error: res(id)=0x80010004, in which case the solution is to increase the System Modules Reserve value_
