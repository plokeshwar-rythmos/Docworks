# Transferring Projects

To transfer a Unity Project from one organization to another, you must be an owner or manager of both organizations. You perform this operation through the [Unity Developer Dashboard](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/projects/). 

**Note**: You do not need to disable Unity Services for this process.

From the Developer Dashboard __Projects__ list, locate the Project you want to transfer, and select __View__.

Select __Settings__ on the left navigation bar, then select __General__ from the drop-down options.

Select the __Transfer this project to another organization__ drop-down, then select the destination organization from the list and click __Transfer__.

A message appears indicating whether the transfer was successful. If you receive an error message, [contact Unity Support](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=65905).
