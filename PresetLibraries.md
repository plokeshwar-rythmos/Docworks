Preset Libraries
================


Preset Libraries contain user created data and persist between sessions. They are integrated into the Color Picker, Gradient Editor and Curve Editors.

* A preset is e.g a color, gradient or an animation curve that is saved by the user.
* A preset library is a collection of presets saved into one file.
* Preset libraries contain personal data or project data. They can be saved either in the user preferences folder or in a 'Editor' folder in the Assets folder. Project preset libraries can then be added to revision control for easy sharing between users on a project and added to Asset Store packages.

Selecting a preset library in the project browser will show its contents in the inspector. From here "Edit.." can be clicked to modify.

Note: The description above shows the standard Unity Color Picker.  There is an option in [Preferences](Preferences) which allows you to use the OS X Color picker instead.
