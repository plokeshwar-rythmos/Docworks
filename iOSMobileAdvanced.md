Determining Device Generation
-----------------------------

Different device generations support different functionality and have widely varying performance. You should query the device's generation and decide which functionality should be disabled to compensate for slower devices. You can find the device generation from the [iOS.DeviceGeneration](ScriptRef:iOS.DeviceGeneration.html) property.

More information about different device generations, performance and supported functionality can be found in our [iPhone Hardware Guide](iphone-Hardware).
