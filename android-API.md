Android Scripting
=================


Most features of the Android devices are exposed through the [Input](ScriptRef:Input.html) and [Handheld](ScriptRef:Handheld.html) classes. For cross-platform projects, UNITY_ANDROID is defined for conditionally compiling Android-specific C# code.

For further information, see the [Input](Input), [Mobile Keyboard](MobileKeyboard) and [Device Property](AndroidMobileAdvanced) pages.
