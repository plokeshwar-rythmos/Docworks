#Setting up Unity Multiplayer

To start using Unity Multiplayer, your project must be [set up to use Unity Services](SettingUpProjectServices). Once you have done this, you can enable the Multiplayer Service.

To do this, open the __Services__ window by selecting __Window__ > __Services__ in the menu bar. In the Services window, select __Multiplayer__.

The __Go To Dashboard__ button takes you to the web-based Services Dashboard, where you can set up the Multiplayer configuration for your project.

If you haven't set up your project with the Multiplayer service yet, you are prompted to set up a __New Multiplayer Configuration__. To do this, enter the number of players you want per room and click __Save__.
