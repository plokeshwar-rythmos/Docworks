# UI Overview

In this overview we'll go through the basics of the UI System. We'll start by introducing the __Canvas__, inside which all UI elements are placed. We will discuss the __Rect Tool__ and __the Rect Transform__ used for element layout. Then we'll look at visual elements such as __Text__ and __Image__, as well as interaction controls such as __Button__ and __Slider__.
