# Using Remote Settings in a Unity project

To use remote settings in a project, first install the Remote Settings package from the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/89317). These Assets provide support for viewing your Remote Settings in the Unity Editor, and for mapping Remote Settings values to the fields and properties of components on your GameObjects. See [Creating and changing Remote Settings](UnityAnalyticsRemoteSettingsCreating) to learn how to define your settings with the Unity Analytics Dashboard.

You can use the [Remote Settings component](UnityAnalyticsRemoteSettingsComponent) to connect remote settings to the appropriate fields and properties of your GameObjects. 

You can also use the [RemoteSettings](ScriptRef:RemoteSettings.html) class to [write your own script logic](UnityAnalyticsRemoteSettingsScripting) for handling Remote Settings.

This section describes how to use Remote Settings in your games and applications:
