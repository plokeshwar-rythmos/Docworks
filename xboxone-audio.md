# Audio

When targetting XboxOne, AudioClips can be encoded using the platform specific XMA codec. Using XMA over a format such as Vorbis has the advantage of native hardware
support. Audio clips can thus remain compressed in memory reducing the CPU, load time,
and overall memory impact of audio playback.

To use XMA for a particular AudioClip, select the clip, select the XboxOne platform, override
the global clip settings and then select the XMA codec as the compression format. 

Remember to click Apply.
