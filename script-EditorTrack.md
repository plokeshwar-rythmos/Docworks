# Setting Track properties

Use the Inspector window to change the name of a track and its properties. The available properties depend on the type of track selected. For example, select an Animation Track to  apply an avatar mask, apply track offsets, and to specify which transforms are modified when performing match offsets between Animation clips.

Not all tracks have properties. See the following dedicated sections for tracks with properties:

* [Activation Track properties](TimelineActivationTrackProperties)

* [Animation Track properties](TimelineAnimationTrackProperties)
