## Out-of-date Collab History information

**Issue**: The information in the **Collab History** window appears to be out of date (for example, if the time next to the latest publish doesn't match when the most recent changes were pushed). 

**Resolution**: Right-click the **Collab History** tab and select **Reload** to retrieve the most recently updated information.

## Project state problems

**Issue**: Your local Project state is the state you want, but you are experiencing conflicts or other problems with the Cloud Project state. 

**Resolution**: Re-link the Project. Open the **Services** tab and navigate to **Settings**. From here, click **Unlink project**, then re-link the Project with a new ID to submit a clean new version of your Project. To do this, click **Select organization** in the Services panel and follow the steps to assign or create an ID.
