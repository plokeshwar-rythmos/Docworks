You will be given the option to create a new Project ID or select an existing one.

If this is the first time you are connecting your project to Unity Services, you'll need to create a new project ID. The organization name is typically the same name as your company. The project name for the new Services ID will automatically be the name of the Unity Project you're currently working on.

If you want, you can change the name of the Services Project ID in the Settings section of the services window.

Alternatively, if you have already set up a Unity Services Project ID for this project you can select the organization and project name from your list of existing projects (see example below). 

**Note:** You will have an existing Unity Services Project ID if you have used one of the other Unity services with this project already, such as Unity Analytics, Ads, Cloud Build, or Multiplayer.
