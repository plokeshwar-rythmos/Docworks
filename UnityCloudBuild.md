#Unity Cloud Build

Unity Cloud Build is a [continuous integration](UnityCloudBuildContinuousIntegration) service for Unity projects. It helps you save time by automating the process of creating builds on Unity’s servers. This automatic process frees your team and your team’s computers from the time-consuming process of making builds. It helps you catch problems sooner, share builds with your collaborators, and iterate versions of your development more rapidly.

Unity Cloud Build can build your project for multiple platforms, and supports many of the popular [version control systems](UnityCloudBuildVcs). See [Supported platforms](UnityCloudBuildSupportedPlatforms) to learn more.
