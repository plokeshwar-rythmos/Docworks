## Setting Clip properties

Use the Inspector window to change the name of a clip, its timing, its blend properties, and other clip properties. The available properties depend on the type of clip selected. For example, select an Activation clip to change its name and set its **Clip Timing**.

Not all clips have properties. See the following dedicated sections for clips with properties:

* [Activation Clip properties](TimelineActivationClipProperties)
* [Animation Clip common properties](TimelineAnimationClipProperties)
* [Animation Clip playable asset properties](TimelineAnimationClipPlayableProperties)
* [Audio Clip properties](TimelineAudioClipProperties)
