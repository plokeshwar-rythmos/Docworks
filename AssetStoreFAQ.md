Asset Store FAQ
===============


What date will I receive my monthly or quarterly transfer?
----------------------------------------------------------


All payouts are scheduled for the 15th of each month

Why haven't I received my payout?
---------------------------------

Check your details are correct in the "Payout" tab in your Publisher Administration account. If everything looks correct and you still haven't received your funds, please contact: **assetstore@unity3d.com**

My package has shown as Pending for a while now, what should I do?
------------------------------------------------------------------


Our Vetting Team receive a huge amount of submissions per week, please be patient when waiting for acceptance. If you feel there may be an issue with your submission, please contact **assetstore@unity3d.com** stating your Publisher and Package details.

Can I merge my account with my co-workers' account or another additional account?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Unfortunately not, once an account has been created and purchases have been made, we cannot swap, merge or edit these purchases to appear in another account.

I can't find my answer here. Can I speak to a human about my issue?
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Of course you can, drop us an email at **assetstore@unity3d.com**. We aim to respond within 24 hours.
