Step 5: Open a pull request on Bitbucket
============

The final step is to open a pull request on Bitbucket. Go back to the landing page for our fork and look at the sidebar again. You will see some new options:

This time, click the __Create Pull Request__ link. You'll be taken to a page that automatically summarises the outgoing changesets and shows you a diff of them (a 'diff' shows the differences or changes between two versions). You can also add a description (a good idea!) and any reviewers:

Finally, you'll be redirected to your pull request. You can share this link with anyone you want, including others on your own team so that they can contribute:
