# The Resources folder

The _Resources_ folder is a common source of many problems in Unity projects. Improper use of the _Resources_ folder can bloat the size of a projectâ€™s build, lead to uncontrollable excessive memory utilization, and significantly increase application startup times.

These problems are described in detail in the Best Practice Guide [AssetBundles and Resources](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/best-practices/guide-assetbundles-and-resources). In particular, refer to the [Resources](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/best-practices/resources-folder) chapter for more information on the above problems.
