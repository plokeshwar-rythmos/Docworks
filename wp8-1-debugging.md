Windows Phone 8.1: Debugging
==========================


|**WARNING: LEGACY DOCUMENTATION** |
|:---|
|Note that that from Unity 2017.1 this documentation is out-dated. 2017-06-30|

When the application crashes without the debugger attached, it is possible to get a dump file, if appropriate settings are enabled on the phone.

* Go to Settings->Feedback
* Enable **Save Info** to **On**
* When the application crashes, the dump file should be saved in *This PC\<Phone Name>\Phone\Documents\Debug*
* **Note:** When the dump file is saved, windows explorer might still show an empty folder, in that case unplug and plug USB cable to force windows explorer to refresh that folder.
