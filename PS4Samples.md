Samples
======

A number of packages are provided for download with each release of Unity for PS4. There are two groups of packages: Plug-ins, and Samples.
 
## PS4 Plug-ins
 
Each plug-in package provides a native plug-in, a managed assembly, and an example project demonstrating the plug-in's use. Every time a new version of Unity is released, a forum post is made in the [scedev.net](http://www.scedev.net/) forums; this is where you can obtain the most recent plug-ins. Documentation and instructions for each plug-in are provided as a _readme.txt_ file alongside the sample Scene when the package is imported into Unity. The native and assembly source code and the _readme.txt_ file are provided as a **.zip** file in the _Assets/Plugins/PS4_ directory.
 
* **NP Toolkit**: Provides APIs for connecting with and using Playstation(R)Network features and awarding trophies
* **SaveData**: Provides API and examples showing how to write SaveData in a TRC compliant way
* **Camera And Tracking**: Demonstrates how to use the PS4's cameras in your application.
* **Speech Recognition**: Demonstrates how to use a native plugin for speech recognition.



## PS4 Samples
 
The sample packages provide example code demonstrating PS4 features that are built into the main Unity runtime. These are available to import directly from the Editor via __Assets__ > __Import Package__ > __PS4 Samples__.

* **Input and Motion**: Demonstrates how to use the input and motion features of the PS4, for example front and back touch, gyroscope, buttons, etc.
* **Video**: Demonstrates how to implement video playback in a PS4 application.
* **Native Plugin**: Demonstrates how to call you own native code from within a Unity script.
* **Move Controller**: Demonstrates how to read data from a PlayStation Move Controller.

Always read the _readme.txt_ files, containing documentation and instructions, if included.
