How to use Android remote
-------------------------

To use Android Remote, you should firstly make sure that you have the latest Android SDK installed (this is necessary to set up port-forwarding on the device). Then, connect the device to your computer with a USB cable and launch the Android Remote app. When you press Play in the Unity editor, the device will act as a remote control and will pass accelerometer and touch input events to the running game.
