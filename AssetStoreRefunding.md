Refunding your customers
===============

Customers may contact you to request a refund on your asset. However, as the purchase was made through the Asset Store, it should be the store that manages the refund - not individual publishers.

If possible, try to help your customer resolve their issue to avoid a refund. If a refund is required, then you must request it form the Asset Store on the customer's behalf, using the following process:

1. Ask the user to provide you with the invoice they received when they purchased the asset.

2. Log in to your [publisher administration page](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/login.html).

3. Verify the invoice using the **Verify Invoice** tab.

4. Once verified, email [assetstore@unity3d.com](mailto:assetstore@unity3d.com) from an email address attached to your publisher account. You must provide either the invoice as an attachment, or the invoice number.

Here is a template request:
