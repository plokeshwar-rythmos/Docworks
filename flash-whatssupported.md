Flash: What is and is not supported
===================================


Supported
---------



* Flash Player 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4
* Full ActionScript API Access
* Lightmapping
* Occlusion culling
* Editor Scripting (JavaScript / C#). Note: for JavaScript, use `#pragma strict.`
* Custom shaders
* Animation / skinning
* Basic types like int, string, List
* Basic audio features, such as AudioSource / AudioListener
* Physics
* Navigation Meshes
* Substance Textures, however the textures are baked at build time so cannot be dynamically changed at runtime
* PlayerPrefs - On Flash PlayerPrefs are stored per SWF per machine
* UnityGUI classes that do not require text input
* Particle System (Shuriken) works and is script accessible
* Asset bundles - These are supported but caching of bundles (i.e. use of LoadFromCacheOrDownload) is not currently supported
* WWW and WWWForm
* Mecanim

  

Limited support
---------------


* Realtime shadows work, but do get affected by bugs in image effects
* Untyped variables in JavaScript and implicit type conversions
* Unity GUI / Immediate mode GUI
* Any .NET specific stuff. Do not use stuff from exotic class libraries (reflection, LINQ etc).
* GUIText wil have a dramatic impact on performance

  

Not Currently Supported
-----------------------


* Image Effects
* Unity profiler
* UnityGUI classes that require text input
* Raknet networking (if you need networking, you can write it in Action Script 3 directly, using flash API)
* Cloth
* VertexLit shaders currently do not support Spot Lights (they are treated just like point lights).
* Advanced audio features, such as audio effects
* Terrain
* Texture mipMapBias
* Non-triangle MeshTopology and wireframe rendering
* AsyncOperation

  

Won't be supported
------------------


* Sockets - It is possible to use ActionScript sockets by implementing them in AS3.
* Deferred rendering

  

Texture Support
---------------


We support `jpeg` textures, as well as RGBA / Truecolor. Textures which are jpg-xr compressed are not readable and thus not supported.

The compression ratio can be specified in the texture import under 'Override for FlashPlayer' setting. Compressed textures get converted to `jpeg` with the chosen compression ratio. The compression ratio is worth experimenting with since it can considerably reduce the size of the final SWF.


![](../uploads/Main/flashtextureoverride.png) 

Texture quality ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no compression, and 0 the highest amount of compression possible. 

The maximum supported texture resolution is 2048x2048.
