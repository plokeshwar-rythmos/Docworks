#The Scene View

![](../uploads/Main/SceneViewCallout.png) 

The __Scene View__ is your interactive view into the world you are creating. You will use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of __Game Object__. Being able to Select, manipulate and modify objects in the Scene View are some of the first skills you must learn to begin working in Unity.
