## About In-App Purchase

An In-App Purchase is the mechanism for the end user to purchase paid content (hereafter "products") in a Unity for PSM application. By using the In-App Purchase feature, features for generating profit can be added to PSM applications.

For example, applications such as the following can be developed when the In-App Purchase feature is used.

* Game applications where it is possible to purchase items and characters that can be used in the game.
Role-playing games where expansion scenarios can be played.
Applications that have a trial version with feature restrictions and can be upgraded to the full version.

The In-App Purchase feature provides a library for PSM applications to execute such processing. By using this library, developers can easily implement the product information obtaining and purchase processing in the In-App Purchase feature.

The following terms are used in In-App Purchasing for PSM applications.

### Product

A product is the content purchased by the end user for a fee.


Product examples: recovery drinks and other herb items, virtual money in games, rights to upgrade a trial application to a full version, wallpaper, additional stages, and additional characters.

There are normal and consumable type products.

* Normal type products are purchased once and cannot be consumed.
* Consumable type products can be consumed. They can be purchased any number of times.


### Ticket

A ticket is the product usage right obtained by the end user at the time of purchase. Tickets are retained in the PSM application as software data.
