# Unity Performance Reporting

Unity Performance Reporting captures and aggregates exception data, to help you understand whatâ€™s happening during run time and to optimize your project faster. Exceptions are updated to the Services Dashboard while the game is running as a completed build, and while in Play Mode within the Editor.

## iOS crash reporting

iOS crash reporting is available to Unity Plus and Pro users as part of the [Unity Performance Reporting](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/performance-reporting) service. Turn on Performance Reporting to track crashes on iOS, including crashes in native user code, engine code, and plug-ins.

See Unity documentation for guidance on [setting up Performance Reporting](UnityPerformanceReportingSettingUp).

When you use [IL2CPP](IL2CPP) and have the [iOS Player Settings](class-PlayerSettingsiOS) __Script Call Optimization__ setting set to __Fast but no exceptions__, iOS crash reporting captures crashes due to uncaught managed exceptions.

See documentation on [iPhone Optimization](iphone-iOS-Optimization) for more information on the __Script Call Optimization__ settings.

## Reports

Reports show the native stack trace of the crashed thread. If the crash is caused by an uncaught managed exception, the reports also show the managed stack trace of where the exception originates from, along with the native stack trace.

Note that iOS crash reporting cannot capture crashes caused by the application running out of memory and then being closed by the operating system.

View your crashes in the [Unity Cloud Developer Dashboard](http://developer.cloud.unity3d.com). Here, select your game and select __Enable Game Performance__ (see Image A).

## Example

The example report below demonstrates what a report for a crash due to a managed exception looks like:


```

Managed Stack Trace:

at CrashTests.CrashNextUpdate () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0

at CrashTests.Update () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0

Native StackTrace:
