#Focus Point

The __Focus Point__ is the value used to tell the device where a user's focus is. This defines a plane that is used to increase hologram quality for content that intersects the plane. Use the `FocusPoint` API to define this plane, to help stabilize the most important content currently in the user's view. The FocusPoint API can be found in [HolographicSettings.SetFocusPointForFrame](ScriptRef:XR.WSA.HolographicSettings.SetFocusPointForFrame.html).

For more information about how the HoloLens achieves stable holograms, see Microsoft's documentation on [Hologram stability](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/holographic/Hologram_stability.html#Stabilization_Plane).
